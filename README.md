WonderfulWaterloo.com data recovery
===========================

WonderfulWaterloo.com, a thriving, vibrant community for urban issues in Waterloo Region, has been taken offline. Its future in uncertain. But archived copies of its content are scattered around the web. Hopefully we can rebuild some of what was lost.

How can I help?
===============

1. **Upload pages/images from your local cache**. If you visited WonderfulWaterloo.com recently before it was taken offline, you may have local copies of those pages saved in your browser's cache. Use one of the methods below to save *anything you can* related to `wonderfulwaterloo.com`. Even if it seems irrelevant, don't delete it.
    - Chrome - use this cache viewing tool: http://www.sensefulsolutions.com/2012/01/viewing-chrome-cache-easy-way.html
    - Firefox - use this extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cacheviewer/
    - Internet Explorer - go to `Tools` > `Internet Options` > `General` tab > `Temporary Internet Files` > `Settings` button > `View Files` button
    - Safari - use this app: http://echoone.com/filejuicer/

> Once you've located your local cache of WonderfulWaterloo pages/assets, please submit a pull request so I can add them here. Or, if you're not familiar with git, get a hold of me at sam@samnabi.com.

2. **Use Warrick to scrape various web archives**. [Warrick](https://code.google.com/p/warrick/wiki/About_Warrick) is a command-line Perl utility for recovering websites from your local cache, archive.org, Google cache, Bing cache, et al. I have already used this tool with some success, but multiple attempts by different machines may deliver more results.

> Please submit a pull request for any data you recover with Warrick. There will be a lot of duplicates, but we can cross that bridge when we get there. No need to filter stuff out on your end.

3. **Clean up and sort this mess of data**. I haven't come up with a solution to this part of the process yet. I'd like to have forum posts accessible as JSON objects or plain text files that are easily readable by machines. Any other suggestions? We're not at this stage yet.
