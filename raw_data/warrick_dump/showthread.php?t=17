    I was at Waterloo Council last night and was able to snap some pics of the developer's presentation. They showed three renderings (the images below are zoomed in and cropped photos of their powerpoint). I think the building looks great and I really hope this thing gets approved. I especially like the townhouses.<br />

    <br />
    The owner of a downtown factory dating back to the First World War wants to tear it down and build a 19-storey condominium building.<br />
    <br />
    A development proposal to rezone 21 Allen St. W. from industrial to multi-residential is before city planners.<br />
    <br />
    The three-storey building is now home to Ontario Table and Chair Co.<br />
    <br />
    It's owned by Randy Kinat, who did not return phone calls from The Record yesterday.<br />
    <br />
    Dale Wideman, chair of the city's heritage committee, said he's concerned about the proposal to tear down the red brick building, which was erected in 1913.<br />
    <br />
    "This building was located in the industrial heart of Waterloo,'' said Wideman, who was notified of the development proposal during a meeting at city hall about a month ago.<br />
    <br />
    The old factory, not far from the Bauer lofts development, is not designated as a heritage property, nor is it recognized for its heritage or cultural value.<br />
    <br />
    The factory was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name was changed to Waterloo Bedding Co.in 1921.<br />
    <br />
    The building is considered a mill construction with sturdy beams and posts, said Marg Rowell, city heritage committee member.<br />
    <br />
    Rowell said the lack of designation does not mean the building isn't of significant value.<br />
    <br />
    "There is nothing I can do especially with the attitude of council right now,'' Wideman said. "It's a foregone conclusion that it (the building) will be removed.''<br />
    <br />
    Wideman said he was disappointed at last week's council meeting when politicians voted to defer a proposal to establish a list of heritage buildings. The committee had recommended 35 buildings be recognized for their heritage value and their historical significance.<br />
    <br />
    The 35 properties were built before 1857, the year Waterloo was incorporated as a village.<br />
    <br />
    Some owners told councillors they were worried a heritage registry could decrease the property values of their buildings. Council then shelved the plan which is expected to return to a council committee meeting on Oct. 6.<br />
    <br />
    Scott Amos, director of development approvals for the City of Waterloo, said the rezoning application for the Allen Street West building will go through a complete development process, the same as any other proposal.<br />
    <br />
    An informal public meeting will be held at a council committee meeting on Sept. 8.<br />
    <br />
    The proposal also includes three houses on Park Street adjacent to the Allen Street building which could also be demolished.<br />
    <br />
    Amos said the owner is also considering a heritage assessment of the property although the city does not require it.<br />
    <br />
    Amos said the owner's proposal follows city policies and fits in with the city's plan to intensify its core area.<br />
    <br />
    "If this was a heritage property, we would be having a different discussion,'' he said. "It's a neat-looking building . . . but every property-owner has existing legal rights to his/her property."<br />
    <br />
    Kinat started his furniture business in 1985 and about 12 years ago moved the business into the Allen Street West building, which was empty.<br />

    Re: Aging Industrial Site Could Be Demolished -- Aug. 26<br />
    <br />
    I am very disappointed to hear that the attractive early 20th century factory building at 21 Allen St. W. will likely be demolished. While the building may not qualify as a heritage property in its own right, it contributes significantly to the appearance and character of what could certainly be called a "heritage neighbourhood." There is no question that tearing it down and building another condominium tower would be a sad and ugly change for this part of Waterloo.<br />
    <br />
    In the mid-20th century, the City of Kitchener allowed many of its most historic and attractive downtown buildings to be torn down.<br />
    <br />
    An obvious example would be the lovely neoclassical-styled city hall, of which only the clock tower survives, standing as a sad and lonely reminder at the Joseph Street entrance to Victoria Park.<br />
    <br />
    At the time, these buildings were felt not to be deserving of protection. Kitchener's downtown has never really recovered from this careless attitude toward its architectural heritage.<br />
    <br />
    However modest the architectural merits of such buildings may be on an individual basis, they are an essential part of our neighbourhoods. Our neighbourhoods are slowly demeaned and eventually lost as these buildings disappear.<br />
    <br />
    Intensification of Waterloo's downtown core is a reasonable goal. But please, city councillors, let condominium towers be built in place of parking lots or on underused land, and not at the cost of our most attractive historic buildings.<br />

    <b><font color="blue"><font size="4">Neighbours alarmed by proposed development at historic site</font></font></b><br />
    By Greg MacDonald, News<br />
    Sep 03, 2008 <br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news/article/141620" target="_blank">http://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news/article/141620</a><br />
    <br />
    A proposed 19-storey development on Allan Street in uptown Waterloo has raised alarm in the neighbouring communities.<br />
    <br />
    An application submitted to the city to develop a condominium tower on the site of the current Ontario Table and Chair building has made residents question whether or not the city should allow a high-density building on a street that is not a major corridor, said Becky Shaw, who lives on Park Street near the proposed site.<br />
    <br />
    Shaw, who moved into her home in April, isn't sure if a 19-storey structure will fit in with the neighbourhood.<br />
    <br />
    "You have an idea of what the neighbourhood is going to be like when you move in, but all of a sudden (a few months) later we're at a meeting telling us (a developer) wants to build what looks like a little Empire State Building just down the street," she said.<br />
    <br />
    She is not against the development of condos nearby, but believes that a structure that will loom over the recently built Bauer lofts will be a little extreme.<br />
    <br />
    Shaw and her neighbours are concerned about the traffic and shadow impacts that the 145-unit tower could have on their quiet neighbourhood just outside of the uptown core.<br />
    <br />
    They're also concerned about losing heritage buildings, according to Shaw. Besides the Ontario Table and Chair building, which was built during the First World War, Shaw figures that three homes slated for demolition if the proposal goes through were built around 1913.<br />
    <br />
    "The neighbourhood is not against development ... we understand the idea of urban sprawl. We're not against the intensification of the downtown core," she said.<br />
    <br />
    "But we need to have development that's not at the expense of heritage and at the expense of our bylaws."<br />
    <br />
    The current official plan for Waterloo deems the uptown core as a place to intensify, but the land that the condo could be built on is zoned industrial.<br />
    <br />
    The city is low on industrial lands and has a policy that it won't rezone any industrial lands.<br />
    <br />
    But they're also looking to intensify the core.<br />
    <br />
    That means the developers would have to go through an official plan amendment, said Trevor Hawkins, development planner for the city.<br />
    <br />
    Aside from re-zoning the land, the developer is also looking to increase density on the land from 250 units per hectare to 465. It's the first application to request that type of density, Hawkins said.<br />
    <br />
    The city will be receiving many more applications like that as intensification happens, said uptown ward Coun. Ian McLean.<br />
    <br />
    "Whether we want to or not, we've got no choice -- we're not growing out, we're growing up," he said.<br />
    <br />
    That doesn't mean, however, that council will agree with the developer's request.<br />
    <br />
    "I'm not taking a position yet," he said. "I'm going to look at the facts.<br />
    <br />
    "We need to weigh the options and achieve a balance where the needs of everyone are met."<br />
    <br />
    That could mean approving the building, allowing the development but reducing the number of storeys or denying it outright, McLean added.<br />
    <br />
    Regardless of what happens with this development, the councillor believes that intensification is coming.<br />
    <br />
    "Waterloo is trying to be the most environmentally progressive community ... intensification goes a long way towards that," he said.<br />
    <br />
    The informal public meeting for the development will take place on Sept. 8 in council chambers.<br />
    <br />
    After that, the proposal will go back to staff and be brought back to council at a later date.

    					   <b><font size="4"><font color="blue">Residents say 19-storey condominium too big for downtown neighbourhood</font></font></b><br />
    September 09, 2008 <br />
    Liz Monteiro, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/411799" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/411799</a><br />
    <br />
    Resident after resident asked councillors last night to take another look at a proposed 19-storey condominium development set for Park and Allen streets in the city core.<br />
    <br />
    The likelihood of more traffic and noise, less sunshine and the loss of heritage are among the concerns raised about the proposed condo tower.<br />
    <br />
    "We are not against development," said Marcia Macks Edwards, who lives in the Catalina townhouse development off Allen Street. "We expect development. We have chosen to live here because we recognize the value of infilling and intensification."<br />
    <br />
    She urged councillors not to box in the Catalina townhouses.<br />
    <br />
    At a committee meeting last night, councillors got more details about the development, which will feature a 145-unit condo tower and nine three-storey townhouses.<br />
    <br />
    The developer, Allen Street Holdings, wants to tear down the 95-year-old building at 21 Allen St. W. known as the Ontario Table and Chair Co. Three adjacent houses at 142, 144 and 148 Park St. would also be demolished.<br />
    <br />
    The factory, built in 1913, was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name was changed to Waterloo Bedding Co. in 1921. The building is not designated as a heritage property or recognized for its cultural value, but heritage advocates say this doesn't mean it shouldn't be saved.<br />
    <br />
    The developer is requesting a zone change for the property, which is about a third of a hectare, Trevor Hawkins, the city development planner, told council. The property is zoned as industrial and the developer wants to change it to multi-residential. Although the city's official plan wants industrial lands unchanged, this property is in the core, where the city wants residential intensification.<br />
    <br />
    The developer is also asking for approval from the city to increase density on the property to 465 units per hectare from 250 units per hectare. The development would also include a three-storey parking garage.<br />
    <br />
    Rebecca Shaw, who lives at 141 Allen St., said a 19-storey building is excessive. She worries about how the increased density and traffic will affect the area.<br />
    <br />
    Residents are also concerned that pedestrians will have to fear for their safety when more cars come in.<br />
    <br />
    Bill Kauffeldt, who lives in the Catalina townhouses, said another highrise will create a ghetto of tall buildings. Nearby tower buildings include Clarica and the Bauer lofts.<br />
    <br />
    The development likely will not come before council until at least December, Hawkins said.<br />
    <br />
    Carol Wiebe, a planning consultant representing developer Randy Kinat, said her client is committed to listening to the neighbourhood's concerns.<br />
    <br />
    "We will try and come back with solutions addressing these concerns. It's finding a balance."<br />
    <br />
    John Arndt, president of North Waterloo Region Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, said the Ontario Table and Chair building is historic and structurally sound and, ultimately, precious. The building is reminiscent of the "glory days" of industry in downtown Waterloo nearly 100 years ago, Arndt told council.<br />
    <br />
    He said the owner should be complimented for restoring the building and conducting a heritage study even though this wasn't required. "But the question is, are the costs too great to save this significant building?"<br />

    <br />
    A plan to erect a 19-storey condominium building at the corner of Allen and Park streets drew more fire Monday, with neighbours blasting the development as it was presented to city council.<br />
    <br />
    Concerns ranged from traffic impacts to shadows to the safety of children as residents pleaded with the city to do something about the proposed development on the current site of the Ontario Table and Chair building.<br />
    <br />
    Developers are asking the city to rezone the site to allow for a 157-unit condominium complex that will require twice the density than the site is currently allocated.<br />
    <br />
    But neighbours are worried that this complex, coupled with the nearby Bauer lofts, will destroy their quiet community. The size of the structure is among the chief concerns.<br />
    <br />
    "We're not against development, but development has to be reasonable," said Becky Shaw, who lives on Park Street across from the site.<br />
    <br />
    Shaw and 10 other concerned citizens voiced their complaints about the development, which will also feature townhouses along its frontage.<br />
    <br />
    And though residents living in the uptown are aware of the need for intensification, this is taking it too far, said Marcia Macks Edwards, who lives in the Catalina townhouse development just off Allen Street.<br />
    <br />
    "We expect development, we expect mixed use but we also expect respect," she said.<br />
    <br />
    When the Catalina townhouses were approved by the previous council, they were envisioned as the new benchmark for environmentally friendly living in the uptown, Edwards said.<br />
    <br />
    Now they're going to get boxed in by high-rises.<br />
    <br />
    "We want you to respect your vision of uptown Waterloo and the official plan," she said.<br />
    <br />
    John Arndt, president of the North Waterloo Region branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, is also concerned about intensification.<br />
    <br />
    He's afraid that the "Manhattanization" of the core could lead to a loss of the city's built history -- something that's already ongoing with the potential loss of the Ontario Table and Chair building, which was built in 1913. The structure is typical of industrial facilities built before the First World War and is one of Waterloo's last linkages to that era.<br />
    <br />
    "Only a few buildings still stand that still represent the Golden Age of industry in the city," Arndt said.<br />
    <br />
    All of these concerns are going to become more common as developers start to intensify, said Carol Wiebe, a consultant with MHBC planning.<br />
    <br />
    Wiebe, who presented council with some of the plans for the development, said she heard the community's concerns and will take them into account. But it's not only developers who will have to deal with these worries, she said.<br />
    <br />
    "I think that in the next 10 years we're going to see some tremendous change " she said. "Council, staff, developers and the neighbourhoods are going to have to deal with issues as the (intensification) policies are implemented."<br />

    					   <b><font size="4"><font color="blue">Waterloo isn’t in good position to balance growth pressures with heritage, says critic</font></font></b><br />
    By Greg MacDonald, Chronicle Staff - News<br />
    Jan 21, 2009<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news/article/159985" target="_blank">http://www.waterloochronicle.ca/news/article/159985</a><br />
    <br />
    One of the biggest challenges facing municipalities over the next few decades will be balancing intensification and heritage. <br />
    But the City of Waterloo isn’t as prepared as its neighbours to deal with the upcoming challenges, according to the former chair of the municipal heritage committee.<br />
    <br />
    Dale Wideman, who was a member of the committee for 12 years, outlined his concerns about the fate of heritage structures in the city at a meeting of the North Waterloo Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario last week.<br />
    <br />
    Wideman, along with city planners and university professors, spoke about the need to balance intensification efforts with the area’s historical markers.<br />
    <br />
    Both the City of Cambridge and the City of Kitchener have heritage planners on staff, but Waterloo has no such position.<br />
    <br />
    That leaves Waterloo’s history at a disadvantage compared to other development concerns, Wideman said.<br />
    <br />
    “Without a heritage planner to have a good grasp of the issues ... I don’t know how the city will fare,” he said.<br />
    <br />
    Wideman considered his relationship with city development staff “adversarial at times” and said that heritage matters weren’t always taken seriously.<br />
    <br />
    “Heritage matters were a very last-minute concern,” Wideman said. “It can’t be on the shoulders of the municipal heritage committee alone.”<br />
    <br />
    That doesn’t mean that the city hasn’t had its successes in preserving its heritage. Wideman points to the Seagram Lofts as a perfect example of intensification and heritage in harmony.<br />
    <br />
    But just down the road is an example of heritage being destroyed, he added.<br />
    <br />
    The Ontario Table and Chair building, one of the last vestiges of Waterloo’s early 20th-century manufacturing heritage, is set to be replaced by a large-scale condominium.<br />
    <br />
    Heritage buildings such as that one can be protected if the city identified significant historical areas in the city.<br />
    <br />
    “Municipalities should be (responsible) to identify which structures should be considered for retention,” Wideman said.<br />
    <br />
    That would primarily be the responsibility of a heritage planner, he added.<br />
    <br />
    Heritage planners from Kitchener and Cambridge also presented at the meeting and laid out their plans to preserve history in their respective cities.<br />
    <br />
    And even though those municipalities have heritage planners, it doesn’t mean that heritage is safe, said Valerie Spring, the planner with the City of Cambridge.<br />
    <br />
    Provincial legislation such as the Places to Grow Act can seriously handcuff any efforts by heritage planners by promoting intensification over preservation, she said.<br />
    <br />
    “I’m worried that Places to Grow encourages insidious, incremental degradation of our neighborhoods,” she said. “It will be the responsibility of planners to make sure that doesn’t happen.”<br />
    <br />
    Like Wideman, Spring points to identification of heritage structures as the first key to preservation.<br />
    <br />
    But it’s also up to city planners to be aware of heritage concerns when working on development applications.<br />
    <br />
    “Right now it seems like a lot of planning is checking boxes,” Spring said. “But when one of these issues (about new development) comes up, a group of people always comes to tell us what makes a neighbourhood special.<br />
    <br />
    “I think as planners we need to listen to them.”<br />
    <br />

    TERRENCE BELFORD, Globe and Mail<br />
    May 15, 2009 at 12:00 AM EDT<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090515.reBelford0515/REStory/RealEstate/home" target="_blank">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servl...ealEstate/home</a><br />
    <br />
    New York newspaper editor Horace Greeley had some oft-quoted words of advice for anyone seeking a new beginning in the 19th-century United States: "Go West, young man, go West."<br />
    <br />
    You can apply that basic principle to GTA empty nesters looking for relief from stiff new condo prices and the hurly-burly of big-city life. Unless they can easily afford anywhere from $500 to $1,100 a square foot for that new two-bedroom suite and are passionate about staying in the GTA, they might well look west and north to smaller cities and towns such as Waterloo, Schomberg and Collingwoood.<br />
    <br />
    All are within an hour's drive — plus or minus — from the pleasures and diversions of Toronto, but offer what for many is an appealing combination of lower condo costs and a more relaxed approach to life.<br />
    <br />
    "The savings can be significant. We are looking at prices 30 per cent to 40 per cent less than in Toronto — square foot costs as low as $285 instead of $500," says Debbie Cosic of In2ition Realty Inc. She has projects on the go in Collingwood and Schomberg.<br />
    <br />
    The Schomberg one offers a deal unlike anything else on the market: A condo on the banks of the Schomberg River plus a villa suite in Wildwood, Fla., about an hour north of St. Petersburg, starting at $350,000 for the pair.<br />
    <br />
    The projects are called Triumph North and Triumph South and are being built by SigNature Developments Inc. of Concord. You can buy suites in either individually or opt to buy both for the price of a single suite in Toronto.<br />
    <br />
    Granted that $350,000 price only gets you a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom unit in Schomberg and an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom winter home in Florida, but there are singles and couples who do not need anything larger.<br />
    <br />
    Buy a Triumph North one-bedroom alone and it will cost about $180,000, compared with anywhere from $250,000 to $330,000 in the GTA, depending on neighbourhood.<br />
    <br />
    If you want more space, it will, of course, cost you more money. Triumph North has suites ranging up to 1,400 square feet with two bedrooms and a den, and Triumph South offers homes that go up in size to 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom bungalows.<br />
    <br />
    As for lifestyle, Schomberg is not Yorkville. It is an old Ontario farming village. No bright lights, no vibrating nightspots. But Newmarket is about 15 minutes away by car, as is Vaughan. And for winter months, you can be in Florida in about three hours by jet with regular flights into Orlando, Tampa and St. Petersburg.<br />
    <br />
    <b>There is another out-of-town project aimed at empty nesters worth mentioning. Mady Development Corp., which has built such high-end communities as the Boat Club and Les Falls on Marco Island in Florida, Hackberry Creek Estates in Irving, Tex., and the Waterfront Shores lakeside community in Windsor, says it is about to give Waterloo its first luxury condo</b>.<br />
    <br />
    "Waterloo has mainly seen loft-style renovations. We saw terrific pent-up demand for a real luxury project," says Charles "Chuck" Mady, president of the Mady Group.<br />
    <br />
    His project is called 144 Park — Uptown Waterloo. The name comes from the street address. The site is in a well-established neighbourhood that includes a mix of shops, boutiques, cafés and nightspots and is about a 10-minute walk from the centre of town.<br />
    <br />
    One of the biggest lures for GTA buyers will be price. With 690-square-foot, one-bedroom suites starting in the mid-$200,000 range, GTA buyers would get a luxury suite in downtown Waterloo at the same price as a mid-market one in Toronto. Somewhat larger too: 144 Park's one-bedroom units are about the size of suites with one bedroom and a den in the city.<br />
    <br />
    Each has a large balcony, not just a smoker's nook. They range in size from 65 square feet to more than 200. Prices include an underground parking spot and a storage locker.<br />
    <br />
    For those wanting bigger spaces, suites run up to 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouses. Three-bedroom condos are in very tight supply in the GTA. There will also be a string of nine, 1,800-square-foot, three-storey, Manhattan brownstone-style townhouses on the site — each with a private elevator.<br />
    <br />
    All suites come with the bells and whistles upscale buyers expect including optional gas-fired ovens and range tops, optional gas fireplaces and the seemingly compulsory granite countertops.<br />
    <br />
    Waterloo may be a bit of a stretch from central Toronto. It would probably mean a 1-1/2-hour drive along the 401, but once there, the city has considerable charm.<br />
    <br />
    In 2007, it was named Canada's "smartest" city. It not only has two top-ranked universities — the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University — but is also the heart of a research triangle that is home to world-class high-tech companies like Research In Motion, creator of the ubiquitous BlackBerry.<br />
    <br />
    In many ways, the proliferation of knowledge-based industries makes the city relatively immune to recessions, Mr. Mady points out. While his target market is empty nesters in the local area, he can see the combination of price and a more relaxed lifestyle winning a place in the hearts and pocketbooks of singles and couples in the Toronto area as well.<br />

    <b>Proposal goes to council June 1</b><br />
    May 20, 2009 <br />
    Liz Monteiro, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://news.therecord.com/article/539600" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/article/539600</a><br />

    <br />
    Residents who live near a proposed condo development in the core area say their concerns about traffic and increased density have been ignored by the developer.<br />
    <br />
    But Randy Kinat, who is co-developing the property at 21 Allen St. W. with Mady Development Corporation of Markham, said "every study possible has been done to ensure our project meets all the requirements.<br />
    <br />
    "When the project is completed, they will find there is no reason for any concern,'' Kinat said yesterday in an interview.<br />
    <br />
    "The luxury we are doing will increase the property values of the uptown area,'' Kinat said.<br />
    <br />
    Kinat said the $60-million luxury condo development will feature concierge services and private elevators in the brownstones.<br />
    <br />
    The 19-storey condo development -- 144 Park -- at the corner of Park and Allen streets comes before council for approval on June 1.<br />
    <br />
    The condo tower will have 149 units as well as eight three-storey brick townhouses.<br />
    <br />
    The development will feature 160 parking spaces, 71 of them underground and a three-storey above-ground garage.<br />
    <br />
    Construction is expected to begin in May 2010, Kinat said.<br />
    <br />
    The plan includes tearing down the existing 95-year-old building, Ontario Table and Chair Co., said city planner Trevor Hawkins.<br />
    <br />
    The factory, built in 1913, was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name changed to Waterloo Bedding Co. in 1921. The building is not designated as a heritage property, nor is it recognized for its cultural value.<br />
    <br />
    Hawkins said the developer has not yet applied for a demolition permit.<br />
    <br />
    City staff will be recommending the developer's proposal to council be approved, Hawkins said.<br />
    <br />
    The plan includes a zone change for the property, which is about one-third of a hectare in area, from industrial to multi-residential and an increase in density.<br />
    <br />
    The developer wants to increase the density to 465 units per hectare from 250 units per hectare.<br />
    <br />
    Hawkins said in exchange for increasing the density, the city will be asking the developer for additional streetscape improvements, including benches, landscaping and bicycle parking.<br />
    <br />
    As well, the city will be asking for improvements along the Iron Horse Trail which is near the development and a piece of public art at the value of one per cent of construction costs.<br />
    <br />
    Tanem Developments, which is building a 175-unit condo development at King Street and University Avenue, gave the city $165,000 for the public square in exchange for approved higher densities.<br />
    <br />
    Hawkins said the cost of the public art has not yet been finalized.<br />
    <br />
    Bill Kauffeldt, who lives in the nearby Catalina townhouse development, said he's concerned about the increased traffic and the lack of sunshine because of the tower building.<br />
    <br />
    Becky Shaw, who lives on Allen Street, said the face of the neighbourhood will change with a second condo tower.<br />
    <br />
    The Bauer Lofts at Park and King streets are set to open in July.<br />
    <br />
    "They haven't taken community input into consideration. It seems that community input doesn't matter,'' she said.<br />
    <br />
    Shaw said she's also worried about the traffic volume and increased density.<br />

    June 02, 2009 <br />
    Liz Monteiro, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://news.therecord.com/article/546416" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/article/546416</a><br />
    <br />
    Waterloo councillors approved a controversial 19-storey condo development at the corner of Park and Allen streets in Waterloo at a committee meeting last night.<br />
    <br />
    After nearly five hours of discussion and debate, councillors gave the go ahead to the developer to build the 143-unit luxury condo project.<br />
    <br />
    "It's the best thing for Uptown Waterloo," said Randy Kinat who owns the building at 21 Allen St. W.<br />
    <br />
    Kinat, along with Mady Development Corporation of Markham, is developing the project.<br />
    <br />
    In an interview after the meeting, Kinat said he, along with city staff, will work with residents in the neighbourhood who are concerned with increased traffic.<br />
    <br />
    Voting against the development was Coun. Diane Freeman and Coun. Ian McLean. Both councillors couldn't support the higher density and Freeman was also worried about the additional traffic in the area.<br />
    <br />
    "We have to look forward and where is our city headed," said Mayor Brenda Halloran, who voted in favour of the project. "We need places to live and work and we need to make our cities walkable."<br />
    <br />
    One after the other, residents had told councillors they aren't happy with the proposal.<br />
    <br />
    Concerns ranged from increased traffic in the neighbourhood, the height of the 19-storey building at 62 metres, a lack of sun because of the height of the building, and the possibility of drivers using neighbourhood roads such as Norman Street as shortcuts.<br />
    <br />
    "We welcome new neighbours but we are concerned with the increased traffic that 144 Park will bring," said Ann Liebau, who lives with her family on Norman Street.<br />
    <br />
    About 10 people asked them to take another look before they approved condo development along with eight three-storey brick townhouses.<br />
    <br />
    In exchange for increasing the density, to 465 units per hectare from 250 units per hectare the city will get additional streetscape and landscaping improvements, including benches, and improvements to the Iron Horse trail and bicycle parking.<br />
    <br />
    David Antscherl said the condo development is a skyscraper and is out of scale for the rest of the neighbourhood.<br />
    <br />
    Chris Leishman, who also lives on Norman Street with his wife and two children, said there are many young families, with 26 children living on Norman Street between Park Street and Avondale Road.<br />
    <br />
    John Arndt, president of the North Waterloo Region Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, said the Ontario Table and Chair Co. building should be saved because the structure is sound.<br />
    <br />
    "It's a shame," he said. "We are at imminent risk of destroying a valued heritage property."<br />
    <br />
    Arndt said if this plan goes ahead, the city is neglecting built heritage. Instead, the developer should incorporate the building into the project and complement the nearby Bauer building.<br />
    <br />
    The factory, built in 1913, was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name changed to Waterloo Bedding Co. in 1921. The building is not designated as a heritage property, nor is it recognized for its cultural value.<br />
    <br />
    City planner Trevor Hawkins said industrial artifacts from the factory will be used in public art on Allen Street and placed along the Iron Horse trail.<br />
    <br />
    At least one person was in favour of the project. Brian O'Heron plans to live there with his wife.<br />
    <br />
    "If you don't approve this it is silliness," he said. "It will be beautiful."<br />
    <br />
    Carol Wiebe from MHBC Planning Ltd., who spoke on behalf of the developer, said traffic will be increased by 10 per cent in the peak morning and afternoon rush hours. Wiebe said the development will generate $775,000 in property taxes for the city.<br />
    <br />
    The $60-million luxury project will feature concierge services and private elevators in the brownstones.<br />
    <br />
    The development will feature 160 parking spaces, 71 of them underground and a three-storey above-ground garage.<br />

    <b>Increased traffic, esthetics among complaints as proposed Waterloo luxury building debated</b><br />

    <br />
    "We welcome new neighbours but we are concerned with the increased traffic that 144 Park will bring," said Ann Liebau, who lives with her family on Norman Street.<br />
    <br />
    Up to eleven people spoke to council at a committee meeting last night and asked them to take another look before they approved 143-unit condo development along with eight three-storey brick townhouses at 21 Allen St. W.<br />
    <br />
    Late last night, councillors had not made a decision and were still listening to delegations.<br />
    <br />
    The developer, Randy Kinat along with Mady Development Corporation of Markham, wants to increase the density to 465 units per hectare from 250 units per hectare.<br />
    <br />
    In exchange for increasing the density, the city will get additional streetscape and landscaping improvements, including benches and improvements to the Iron Horse trail and bicycle parking.<br />

    <br />
    Chris Leishman, who also lives on Norman Street with his wife and two children, said there are many young families living on Norman Street between Park Street and Avondale Road.<br />
    <br />
    Aimée Morrison, who moved to the area in 2005, said she's worried about the "uncareful promotion of high density."<br />
    <br />
    Morrison said she, too, is in favour of intensification but she says the proposed development is too large, too tall and the site is too small.<br />
    <br />
    John Arndt, president of the North Waterloo Region Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, said the Ontario Table and Chair Co. building should be saved because the structure is sound.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    The factory, built in 1913, was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name changed to Waterloo Bedding Co. in 1921.<br />
    <br />
    The building is not designated as a heritage property, nor is it recognized for its cultural value.<br />
    <br />
    City planner Trevor Hawkins said industrial artifacts from the factory will be used in public art on Allen Street and placed along the Iron Horse trail.<br />
    <br />
    At least one person was in favour of the project. Brian O'Heron plans to live there with his wife.<br />
    <br />
    "If you don't approve this it is silliness," he said. "It will be beautiful."<br />
    <br />
    Carol Wiebe from MHBC Planning Ltd., who spoke on behalf of the developer, said traffic will be increased by 10 per cent in the peak morning and afternoon rush hours. Wiebe said the development will generate $775,000 in property taxes for the city.<br />
    <br />
    The $60-million luxury project will feature concierge services and private elevators in the brownstones.<br />
    <br />
    The development will feature 160 parking spaces, 71 of them underground and a three-storey above-ground garage.

    June 04, 2009 <br />
    Liz Monteiro, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://news.therecord.com/article/547572" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/article/547572</a><br />
    <br />
    <img src="/web/20131109232905im_/http://media.therecord.topscms.com/images/64/e5/a14e628c4c3491bc7ffc4ad46187.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
    <br />
    There are two kinds of condo buyers in Waterloo Region.<br />
    <br />
    Even in a recession, average condominium buyers are empty-nesters and young professionals, such as tech workers, say condo developers.<br />
    <br />
    The empty-nesters live in suburbia and, now that their children are grown and leaving the house, they no longer want or need a large home and all the upkeep that goes with it, said Vickie Griffiths, who works for a Toronto-based marketing company that helps developers market condos.<br />
    <br />
    Young professionals want to live in a maintenance-free building in the core area, and walk to stores and restaurants.<br />
    <br />
    Take Jeff Gadway. He's a Wilfrid Laurier University business graduate who's worked in marketing at RIM for three years.<br />
    <br />
    Gadway is 24 and looking to buy his first home.<br />
    <br />
    He was at a recent private preview for luxury condos at 144 Park, a 19-storey condo development with 143 units set for the corner of Park and Allen streets in Waterloo. The project will also include eight three-storey brick townhouses.<br />
    <br />
    The development was approved by council this spring despite about 10 people speaking out against it, concerned with increased traffic and the high density of the building.<br />
    <br />
    Gadway, who works long hours and travels for his job, says he's attracted to urban living and wants to move to the core area, walking to a revitalized uptown with restaurants and bars.<br />
    <br />
    "I feel like I'm more suited to a condo lifestyle,'' said Gadway, who currently rents off Fischer-Hallman and Westmount roads.<br />
    <br />
    Randy Kinat, who is co-developing 144 Park with Mady Development Corp. of Markham, said about 700 people had registered with his office by mid-May and shown interest in buying a condo.<br />
    <br />
    Kinat said private viewings will be held with corporate groups, such as RIM, Sun Life, KPMG, and PricewaterhouseCoopers.<br />
    <br />
    A one-bedroom condo starts at $235,000, while a two-bedroom with a den is priced at about $500,000. Two of the eight penthouses are more than $1 million, Kinat said.<br />
    <br />
    Richard Magnussen and his wife live in a house in the Deer Ridge subdivision in Kitchener and are considering buying a 2,000-square-foot penthouse.<br />
    <br />
    "We like the turnkey aspect of the condo,'' said Magnussen, who owns a furniture company based in New Hamburg. The couple has three adult children.<br />
    <br />
    Magnussen, who travels often on business, said condo living fits his lifestyle.<br />
    <br />
    "It's a cool building,'' said Magnussen, who was attracted by the luxury and living close to restaurants and the soon-to-open Vincenzo's.<br />
    <br />
    Stephanie Edwards lives in a house in the Beechwood neighbourhood with her 17-year-old daughter. But her daughter is headed for university and Edwards is looking to downsize.<br />
    <br />
    "I'm tired of cutting grass and weeding gardens,'' said Edwards, 37.<br />
    <br />
    Edwards, who works as a sales manager for Royal Bank in southwestern Ontario, said the high-end condo at 144 Park wouldn't be out of her range.<br />
    <br />
    But Edwards said as a potential buyer, she must look closely at the package of information and the agreement. "It's more than saying 'I like the floor plan,"' she said.<br />
    <br />
    Peter Maxwell of Momentum Developments, which is building a 55-unit condo building at Bridgeport Road and Peppler Street, said about 65 per cent of their buyers are young professionals.<br />
    <br />
    The condo building, labelled as eco chic, has four units left. Construction will begin in July and people can move in next summer.<br />
    <br />
    In Cambridge, the Waterscape project in downtown Galt is under construction and buyers will be moving in next spring, said Paul De Haas, the developer behind the 115-unit tower at the north intersection of Water and Ainslie streets.<br />
    <br />
    Seventy per cent of the units are sold and nearly three-quarters of typical buyers are couples over 50, he said.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    Busy professionals and empty-nesters partial to luxurious urban living are among those expected to explore 144 Park - Uptown Waterloo, an up-and-coming condominium development in one of Waterloo's best known neighbourhoods.<br />
    <br />
    Set to break ground in spring 2010, 144 Park (located at Park and Allen Streets and the former home of Ontario Table and Chair) represents the work of John Chow of Turner Fleischer Architects Inc., the same company that designed Toronto's Hazelton Hotel. Comprised of two elements - a stunning 19-storey brick, stone and glass high-rise and a base of nine three-storey townhomes inspired by Manhattan brownstones - the elegant address also promises comfort and convenience.<br />
    <br />
    "It's going to be remarkable," affirms consultant, Brian Bennett, of the one acre development.<br />
    <br />
    "It presents a great opportunity to live in an upscale development in a very desirable area ... close to lots of shops, cafes, restaurants and the Iron Horse Trail."<br />
    <br />
    Within the tower, approximately 150 suites spanning 690 to 2,700 square feet offer exquisite, open living spaces with one-bedroom, one-bedroom plus den, two-bedroom and two-bedroom plus den configurations. Three bedrooms designs are available via the penthouses. Enviable appointments such as nine-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, granite countertops, ceramic tile, engineered hardwood, lushly carpeted bedrooms and optional gas fireplaces grace each home's interior while Energy Star appliances, low flush toilets, high efficiency heating and cooling and a choice of electric or gas range tops and ovens represent the quality mechanicals. Each suite also includes its own balcony ranging from 65 to 200 square feet.<br />
    <br />
    The townhomes, in turn, offer superb 1,800 square foot layouts, each with a private elevator, and the same interior appointments offered by the suites. Exteriors will complement the existing architecture of the surrounding neighbourhood.<br />
    <br />
    With regard to 144 Park's amenities - all of which are intended to encourage a relaxing, carefree lifestyle - Bennett confirms a full-time, executive concierge, a guest suite for visiting family and friends, a state-of-the-art fitness centre, a 2,500 square foot landscaped outdoor terrace with lounging, entertaining and barbeque spaces, a party room with kitchen and bar and a home theatre with big screen television and surround sound. A carwash bay within the underground parking garage, ample bicycle storage and storage lockers are added bonuses.<br />
    <br />

    <br />
    "You'll have an opportunity to see the site plan, the exterior design of the building, various floorplans as well as vignettes of the kitchens, living areas and bathrooms and ask questions."<br />

    <b><font size="4"><font color="blue">Intense concern over intensification</font></font></b><br />
    <b>Province's planning initiatives bound to chafe existing residents</b><br />
    June 20, 2009 <br />
    Brian Blackmere<br />
    <a href="/web/20131109232905/http://news.therecord.com/article/556576" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/article/556576</a><br />
    <br />
    The Waterloo Region Home Builders' Association (WRHBA) has participated in the development of policies at the provincial, regional and local levels of government to help protect housing choice and affordability for new home buyers. It is abundantly clear that all current policies lead to more density, intensification and redevelopment in existing residential areas.<br />
    <br />
    It was interesting to see that the editorial staff at both the Record and the Waterloo Chronicle in their June 3rd editions picked up on the issue of intensification initiatives prompted primarily by the recent approval by Waterloo Council of the 144 Park Street project. This is the site of the old Ontario Table and Chair building at Park Street and Allen Street in Waterloo that is now approved to proceed with a 19-storey condominium development along the King Street corridor.<br />
    <br />
    The 144 Park Street development did not create the policies that direct developers to better utilize existing infrastructure and create density that would support transit; they are only implementing those policies.<br />
    <br />
    Both articles rightly highlight the fact that the intensification that current planning legislation bestows on this Region will, by its very nature, continue to create confrontations between development interests trying to implement it and surrounding neighbourhoods that neither understand the planning context, nor want to understand it, if it means change to their immediate circumstance.<br />
    <br />
    Change is something that mankind's psyche inherently shuns even though it has been borne out over the course of history that adaption to change is what so often defines the human spirit. Waterloo Councilor Jan d'Ailly summed it up well when he said, "Intensification can be scary, it really can."<br />
    <br />
    Scary or not, this Region is on the cusp of significant changes in land use and housing form all being brought about by new regulations emanating from the Province and filtering down through Regional and local Official Plans. We also cannot ignore the huge impact that the possible reinvention of our transit system will have on land uses that will flank its route. The changes to transit being contemplated are viewed as being the catalyst of change supporting additional intensification.<br />
    <br />
    There are not many residential neighbourhoods in this Region that should consider themselves exempt from intensification initiatives and all residents across this Region would be well advised to take some time to explore the realities of our new planning regime. Contact the Region or your local municipality with questions about long term land use planning and how it may affect your personal situation. There are not always definitive answers available but in some cases you may find that plans and regulations already exist that are there to promote change.<br />
    <br />
    Local Councils have stated for years that they want the power to ensure difficult planning decisions are made locally, not by the Ontario Municipal Board. If this is true, our elected officials must all demonstrate the kind of strength shown by Waterloo Council when they approved the 144 Park Street project. Change doesn't have to be scary if everyone who has a part to play is fully informed.<br />
    <br />

    					   I'm interested to see if anything happens to that second &quot;half&quot; of that block.  And how it'll affect the Iron Horse Trail.  If both developments butt right up to the trail and they use a lot of trees as to provide a buffer between building and trail it could provide a really nice/interesting part of the trail.  I can picture it being a sort of canopy over the trail.  A bit of nature in the middle of an urban area.

    					   Yes 100% residential, which is fine IMO since there's a lot of commercial the next block over at Bauer.  I'm heading uptown this afternoon so I'll try to get an update on sales.  Roughly speaking when i was there in early September the figure they gave was 20% sold, by the end of Sept (after the new financing structure had been launched - see price list above) I was told 30%.

    					   It was from email and some by mail.  We got notified when they changed the down payment structure.  They messed up big time with that and it shows in the sales.   The sales people also were telling people back when it went on sale that it would sell out asap so better buy now. I know a couple of people who won't even go back after they got the letter.<br />
    <br />
    It's 100 residential they just plan on reaping the benefits of being beside the Bauer Buildings.<br />
    <br />
    They were supposed to make a &quot;build&quot; or &quot;no build&quot; decision in December and that never happened.  I am hoping the sales pickup in the spring or once the Bauer is finished and more people get a sense what the area could be like. Unfortunately I think this project won't even get the go ahead to build until the end of 2010 and maybe start building late 2011 or so.<br />
    <br />
    Once Center Block sales office opens in August like they claim it will, it might make for some competition.  I know it's Kitchener but still I think some people might like it especially if it's cheaper.  Also if Barrel Yards another delayed project ever opens a sales office for the condo part of the project that will take people away, with it being in Uptown as well.

    					   One thing that could hurt 144 is that since it's a more expensive project you wouldn't get as many investors buying properties to rent.  Whereas with a less expensive project you would see that happening more often.  This doesn't make a huge difference, but its one small factor.

    					   I was at the sales centre today and it seems like the units have been selling pretty well. I was also really impressed with the sales office, that Table and Chair building is really cool, its to bad that the development wasn't the next corner over for that reason alone. Seeing the 3D model of 144 Park really gives you an impression of how impressive this building will be. The roof top terrace also looks really cool, I also think the large wall size windows are another awesome feature. The sales rep told me that they hope to demolish the current buildings in spring and hope to have shovels in the ground for 144 Park in August, with occupancy aimed for 2012. I really wish the BarrelYards and/or the Centre Block sales office's were open for something to compare to. I also never really noticed that the parking structure is above ground just hidden by the brownstones, which I feel helps to give the building a very prominent podium style. He said this was done to hopefully avoid some of the problems the Bauer Builder faced, with underground parking.  <br />
    <br />
    All in all I would like to see this project go ahead, and I would like to see future projects by Mady Developments come to Waterloo Region.

    					   That is great news!<br />
    <br />
    So they are building even if they haven't sold 70% or so of the units?<br />
    <br />
    The fact that the parking is above ground is a great idea after what happened to Bauer.  There is no way that land is clean deep in the ground.<br />
    <br />
    Do they have a suite setup?  or is it still just the kitchen/bath
