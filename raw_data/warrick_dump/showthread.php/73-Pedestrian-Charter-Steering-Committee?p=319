We encourage and monitor the implementation of the Pedestrian Charter in the local municipalities in Waterloo Region. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur activities include reviewing regional and municipal policies, advocating for pedestrians in the media, and making public presentations to municipal councillors, staff and relevant community organizations. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>What Is a Pedestrian Charter? </b><br />\r\nThe Pedestrian Charter is a set of principles about the value of walking. <br />\r\n<a href="/web/20100203145109/http://www.together4health.ca/files/upload/pedestrian_charter.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read the full Pedestrian Charter as adopted in Waterloo Region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Why Have a Pedestrian Charter? </b><br />\r\nMunicipalities with a Pedestrian Charter know that walking is important for health and the environment. The charter helps city and regional councils, staff, and citizens think about how to encourage walking. The charter calls for infrastructure and policies that support walking.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Who Has Adopted the Pedestrian Charter? </b><br />\r\nIn 2005, the Region of Waterloo, the City of Kitchener and the City of Cambridge adopted the Pedestrian Charter. In 2008, the City of Waterloo adopted a customized version of the Pedestrian Charter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Why Does Walking Matter? </b><br />\r\nMany people rely on walking to get around. Even many car and transit trips begin and end by walking. A walkable city is safer and makes it easier for people to walk more. And the more people walk, the healthier they are - and the cleaner our air is. Walking is also an important option for people who can\'t afford a car.\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			\r\n\r\n\r\n		</div>\r\n			\r\n\r\n                        	\r\n		        \r\n			\r\n			<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><a href="showthread.php?t=116" rel="nofollow" title="Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116"><font color="Green"><font size="2"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Kitchener &amp; Nominate our Other Municipalities </b></font></font></a></div></blockquote>\r\n			\r\n\r\n			\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="postfoot">\r\n		<div class="textcontrols">\r\n			<span class="postcontrols">\r\n				<img style="display:none" id="progress_318" src="images/misc/progress.gif"  alt="" />\r\n				\r\n\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<a id="qrwq_318" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=318" rel="nofollow" ><img id="quoteimg_318" src="images/buttons/trans_40b.png" alt="Reply With Quote" /> Reply With Quote</a>\r\n					<span class="seperator">&nbsp;</span>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</span>\r\n\r\n			<span class="postlinking">\r\n				\r\n					\r\n				\r\n				\r\n\r\n				 \r\n				\r\n\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					 \r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n			</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n  ';

The City of Waterloo is thinking about it. Other cities, such as Toronto and Ottawa, have adopted the charter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The walkability of a community is an indicator of the quality of life of that community,&quot; Jennifer Robertson-Wilson of the Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee, says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd Wellar has lots of advice for improving the quality of life in our cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA municipality, he said, should not receive any transportation-related funds from Queen\'s Park or Ottawa until it has a plan for increasing walking, cycling and the use of public transit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nClimate change, increasing oil prices, traffic congestion and poor air quality will force changes on city governments and individuals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If walkability doesn\'t become a major part of transportation planning in the next 10 years, I think you are in trouble,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA quick look at some of the municipal budgets in this region shows there is no balance to transportation spending. Roads get the overwhelming amount of taxpayer dollars; sustainable transportation -' + '- walking, cycling and transit -' + '- get comparatively little.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, Kitchener will spend $17.2 million on roads, $1.6 million on sidewalks and $486,000 on paths and trails.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCambridge will spend $10.3 million on roads, $225,000 on sidewalks, $204,000 for on-road bike lanes, and $35,000 for off-road trails.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Waterloo, roads will get $6.9 million, sidewalks $254,000 and bike paths $250,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Let\'s be honest, the vast majority of money goes into roads,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaterloo Region is the only municipal government in this region that approaches balanced spending between infrastructure for roads and sustainable transportation -' + '- at least for 2008.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaterloo Region will spend $92.5 million this year on roads. But it will also spend $81 million on Grand River Transit. It will also spend $1.6 million to build 108 kilometres of sidewalks and bike paths.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMunicipal governments must do a lot more to get people using sustainable transportation, Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We are talking about simul-taneously increasing walking, biking and transit and at the same time decreasing the use of the private automobile,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nData on sustainable transportation from the most recent census shows that pedestrian advocates have a lot of work to do when it comes to changing the behaviour of people in the cities of this region. For the first time ever, the 2005 census asked people how they get around -' + '- driving a car, riding in a car, walking, cycling or transit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Cambridge, 60,560 use private vehicles, 2,190 use transit, 2,020 walk and 565 cycle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Kitchener, 104,750 use private vehicles, 6,445 ride buses, 4,870 walk and 1,360 ride bikes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Waterloo, 49,530 use vehicles while 2,270 use transit, 3,740 walk and 1,525 ride bicycles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuch numbers don\'t discourage Wellar, who says cities must spend more on sustainable transportation before more people walk, ride bicycles or use transit. In short, stop treating pedestrians like third-class citizens, he says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If you want to encourage walking, you don\'t want people standing in snow, standing in slush, standing in water,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellar is scathing in his criticism of cities that do not plow sidewalks in the winter. The cities in this region plow some sidewalks in their downtowns and some public property. But city crews do not remove snow from the overwhelming majority of sidewalks and bus-stops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I don\'t believe it. Wow! It seems to me there is some money to be made here. This is shocking,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe testified recently in a lawsuit where a Toronto man sued the city after slipping and falling on a winter sidewalk. The man broke his knee. That case is still before the court.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellar was also an expert witness in a slip-and-fall case in Ottawa where a woman broke her ankle. She was awarded thousands of dollars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If I was going to be an expert witness at a trial I would love to do it here. If a municipality defaults snow clearing to citizens it is a recipe for disaster,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cities of this region require property owners adjacent to city sidewalks to clear the snow within 24 hours after the end of a storm. Other cities, such as London and Guelph, plow all city-owned sidewalks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPriority for snow-clearing should be transit routes and sidewalks, not roads, he says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMunicipal governments are willing to see citizens get hurt, and then make payments in slip-and-fall cases, rather than clear sidewalks of snow, Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;That strikes me as pretty disgusting logic,&quot; Wellar says. &quot;You have to be concerned that bean counters are calling the shots.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver the past nine years, the cities of this region paid about $1.5 million in claims after someone slipped on a public sidewalk.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Cambridge, the payouts totalled $192,542 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2007, when payments totalled $130,550.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Kitchener, the payouts have totalled $1.1 million since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003 when the city paid out $205,442.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Waterloo, the payments totalled $234,906 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003, when the city paid out $81,578.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it comes to treating pedestrians as third-class citizens, Wellar traces the problem to a book called the Highway Capacity Manual, Bureau of Public Roads, in the United States. A Bible of sorts for traffic engineers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first order of business, according to that influential tome, is the convenience, comfort and safety of drivers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellar developed the walkability security index for the City of Ottawa more than 10 years ago, subverting the principles used by traffic engineers in the manual.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was done, in part, to counter the arguments of traffic engineers at hearings of the Ontario Municipal Board -' + '- a provincial tribunal that rules on land-use disputes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCity governments should be increasing the safety, comfort and convenience of pedestrians with every street, sidewalk, intersection, roundabout, trail, bike path and set of traffic signals, Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, traffic signals are used at intersections to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, not the safe crossing of pedestrians.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd the expansion of intersections usually spells disaster for walkers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What is our legal liability here?&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA walkability test should be applied to all transportation projects, every city\'s Official Plan, amendments to those plans, each application to change land use in a municipality, and site plan agreements for individual developments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWellar says sidewalks and pedestrian paths should be designed and constructed to serve and promote community and neighbourhood walkability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile increasing expenditures on infrastructure for walking, biking and public transit, city governments should stop widening roads. Parking lots along King Street should be zoned out of existence and replaced with high-density housing because it is well served by public transit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You are not dependent on an automobile if you can walk, ride a bike or take transit. So it is a choice. It is a proclivity. It\'s just proclivity. It is not dependence at all,&quot; Wellar says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>The numbers</b><br />\r\n214,840 - People who rely on vehicles to get around, according to the 2005 census, in Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo.<br />\r\n10,905 - People who take transit in the three cities, according to the 2005 census.<br />\r\n3,450 - People riding bikes to get from place to place.<br />\r\n34.4 million - Spending in dollars on roads this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br />\r\n2 million - Spending on sidewalks this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br />\r\n1.5 million - Payments over nine years by the region\'s cities because of claims by people who slip on sidewalks.\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			\r\n\r\n\r\n		</div>\r\n			\r\n			<!-' + '- edit note -' + '->\r\n			<blockquote class="postcontent lastedited">\r\n<!-' + '-						<img src="images/buttons/edit_40b.png" alt="" /> -' + '->\r\n				\r\n					Last edited by UrbanWaterloo; 01-03-2010 at <span class="time">05:27 AM</span>.\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</blockquote>\r\n			<!-' + '- / edit note -' + '->\r\n			\r\n\r\n                        	\r\n		        \r\n			\r\n			<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><a href="showthread.php?t=116" rel="nofollow" title="Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116"><font color="Green"><font size="2"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Kitchener &amp; Nominate our Other Municipalities </b></font></font></a></div></blockquote>\r\n			\r\n\r\n			\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="postfoot">\r\n		<div class="textcontrols">\r\n			<span class="postcontrols">\r\n				<img style="display:none" id="progress_319" src="images/misc/progress.gif"  alt="" />\r\n				\r\n\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<a id="qrwq_319" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=319" rel="nofollow" ><img id="quoteimg_319" src="images/buttons/trans_40b.png" alt="Reply With Quote" /> Reply With Quote</a>\r\n					<span class="seperator">&nbsp;</span>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</span>\r\n\r\n			<span class="postlinking">\r\n				\r\n					\r\n				\r\n				\r\n\r\n				 \r\n				\r\n\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					 \r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n			</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n  ';

    April 21, 2008 <br />
    Terry Pender, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br />
    <br />
    <img src="/web/20100203145109im_/http://media.therecord.com/images/5c/58/4ccc5b864809b77ede5c127dcf79.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
    Barry Wellar says municipalities should put pedestrians comfort ahead of driver comfort.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Barry Wellar is helping pedestrians, cyclists and transit users take back their streets.<br />
    <br />
    For too long, city governments have catered to drivers of privately owned vehicles, sacrificing the safety of pedestrians and the environment, according to Wellar, professor emeritus, department of geography at the University of Ottawa.<br />
    <br />
    These days, he is an expert witness in cases where people sue municipal governments after slipping and falling on sidewalks, or after pedestrians are hit by cars.<br />
    <br />
    He was in Waterloo recently speaking to a citizens' group -- the Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee -- about how to get municipal governments to make cities more pedestrian-friendly.<br />
    <br />
    The steering committee wants the cities of this region to implement the principles of the Pedestrian Charter, which is sort of a bill of rights for walkers and cyclists.<br />
    <br />
    The charter has been adopted by Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo Region. The City of Waterloo is thinking about it. Other cities, such as Toronto and Ottawa, have adopted the charter.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;The walkability of a community is an indicator of the quality of life of that community,&quot; Jennifer Robertson-Wilson of the Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee, says.<br />
    <br />
    And Wellar has lots of advice for improving the quality of life in our cities.<br />
    <br />
    A municipality, he said, should not receive any transportation-related funds from Queen's Park or Ottawa until it has a plan for increasing walking, cycling and the use of public transit.<br />
    <br />
    Climate change, increasing oil prices, traffic congestion and poor air quality will force changes on city governments and individuals.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;If walkability doesn't become a major part of transportation planning in the next 10 years, I think you are in trouble,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    A quick look at some of the municipal budgets in this region shows there is no balance to transportation spending. Roads get the overwhelming amount of taxpayer dollars; sustainable transportation -- walking, cycling and transit -- get comparatively little.<br />
    <br />
    This year, Kitchener will spend $17.2 million on roads, $1.6 million on sidewalks and $486,000 on paths and trails.<br />
    <br />
    Cambridge will spend $10.3 million on roads, $225,000 on sidewalks, $204,000 for on-road bike lanes, and $35,000 for off-road trails.<br />
    <br />
    In Waterloo, roads will get $6.9 million, sidewalks $254,000 and bike paths $250,000.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;Let's be honest, the vast majority of money goes into roads,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    Waterloo Region is the only municipal government in this region that approaches balanced spending between infrastructure for roads and sustainable transportation -- at least for 2008.<br />
    <br />
    Waterloo Region will spend $92.5 million this year on roads. But it will also spend $81 million on Grand River Transit. It will also spend $1.6 million to build 108 kilometres of sidewalks and bike paths.<br />
    <br />
    Municipal governments must do a lot more to get people using sustainable transportation, Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We are talking about simul-taneously increasing walking, biking and transit and at the same time decreasing the use of the private automobile,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    Data on sustainable transportation from the most recent census shows that pedestrian advocates have a lot of work to do when it comes to changing the behaviour of people in the cities of this region. For the first time ever, the 2005 census asked people how they get around -- driving a car, riding in a car, walking, cycling or transit.<br />
    <br />
    In Cambridge, 60,560 use private vehicles, 2,190 use transit, 2,020 walk and 565 cycle.<br />
    <br />
    In Kitchener, 104,750 use private vehicles, 6,445 ride buses, 4,870 walk and 1,360 ride bikes.<br />
    <br />
    In Waterloo, 49,530 use vehicles while 2,270 use transit, 3,740 walk and 1,525 ride bicycles.<br />
    <br />
    Such numbers don't discourage Wellar, who says cities must spend more on sustainable transportation before more people walk, ride bicycles or use transit. In short, stop treating pedestrians like third-class citizens, he says.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;If you want to encourage walking, you don't want people standing in snow, standing in slush, standing in water,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    Wellar is scathing in his criticism of cities that do not plow sidewalks in the winter. The cities in this region plow some sidewalks in their downtowns and some public property. But city crews do not remove snow from the overwhelming majority of sidewalks and bus-stops.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;I don't believe it. Wow! It seems to me there is some money to be made here. This is shocking,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    He testified recently in a lawsuit where a Toronto man sued the city after slipping and falling on a winter sidewalk. The man broke his knee. That case is still before the court.<br />
    <br />
    Wellar was also an expert witness in a slip-and-fall case in Ottawa where a woman broke her ankle. She was awarded thousands of dollars.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;If I was going to be an expert witness at a trial I would love to do it here. If a municipality defaults snow clearing to citizens it is a recipe for disaster,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    The cities of this region require property owners adjacent to city sidewalks to clear the snow within 24 hours after the end of a storm. Other cities, such as London and Guelph, plow all city-owned sidewalks.<br />
    <br />
    Priority for snow-clearing should be transit routes and sidewalks, not roads, he says.<br />
    <br />
    Municipal governments are willing to see citizens get hurt, and then make payments in slip-and-fall cases, rather than clear sidewalks of snow, Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;That strikes me as pretty disgusting logic,&quot; Wellar says. &quot;You have to be concerned that bean counters are calling the shots.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Over the past nine years, the cities of this region paid about $1.5 million in claims after someone slipped on a public sidewalk.<br />
    <br />
    In Cambridge, the payouts totalled $192,542 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2007, when payments totalled $130,550.<br />
    <br />
    In Kitchener, the payouts have totalled $1.1 million since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003 when the city paid out $205,442.<br />
    <br />
    In Waterloo, the payments totalled $234,906 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003, when the city paid out $81,578.<br />
    <br />
    When it comes to treating pedestrians as third-class citizens, Wellar traces the problem to a book called the Highway Capacity Manual, Bureau of Public Roads, in the United States. A Bible of sorts for traffic engineers.<br />
    <br />
    The first order of business, according to that influential tome, is the convenience, comfort and safety of drivers.<br />
    <br />
    Wellar developed the walkability security index for the City of Ottawa more than 10 years ago, subverting the principles used by traffic engineers in the manual.<br />
    <br />
    This was done, in part, to counter the arguments of traffic engineers at hearings of the Ontario Municipal Board -- a provincial tribunal that rules on land-use disputes.<br />
    <br />
    City governments should be increasing the safety, comfort and convenience of pedestrians with every street, sidewalk, intersection, roundabout, trail, bike path and set of traffic signals, Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    Currently, traffic signals are used at intersections to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, not the safe crossing of pedestrians.<br />
    <br />
    And the expansion of intersections usually spells disaster for walkers.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;What is our legal liability here?&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    A walkability test should be applied to all transportation projects, every city's Official Plan, amendments to those plans, each application to change land use in a municipality, and site plan agreements for individual developments.<br />
    <br />
    Wellar says sidewalks and pedestrian paths should be designed and constructed to serve and promote community and neighbourhood walkability.<br />
    <br />
    While increasing expenditures on infrastructure for walking, biking and public transit, city governments should stop widening roads. Parking lots along King Street should be zoned out of existence and replaced with high-density housing because it is well served by public transit.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;You are not dependent on an automobile if you can walk, ride a bike or take transit. So it is a choice. It is a proclivity. It's just proclivity. It is not dependence at all,&quot; Wellar says.<br />
    <br />
    <b>The numbers</b><br />
    214,840 - People who rely on vehicles to get around, according to the 2005 census, in Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo.<br />
    10,905 - People who take transit in the three cities, according to the 2005 census.<br />
    3,450 - People riding bikes to get from place to place.<br />
    34.4 million - Spending in dollars on roads this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br />
    2 million - Spending on sidewalks this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br />
    1.5 million - Payments over nine years by the region's cities because of claims by people who slip on sidewalks.
