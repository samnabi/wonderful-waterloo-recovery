At least eight years will pass before it is completed. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the Liberal government says it will happen, after decades of uncertainty and years of planning. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&#8220;We are going to build this highway,&#8221; transportation minister Donna Cansfield announced at a news conference Friday afternoon at regional headquarters in Kitchener. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCansfield cited congestion, safety concerns, and economic development as reasons to build the new highway. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will run just north of the current Highway 7, a two-lane commuting route long plagued by congestion and some terrible collisions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nArea politicians and business leaders beamed as the new highway was announced in Kitchener. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nReplacing Highway 7 has long been considered a leading transportation concern. Successive provincial governments have been lobbied hard and long to move forward on a much-studied proposal. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will be at least three years before there&#8217;s a shovel in the ground. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe province will use these years to finalize the design, acquire property and consult with the public about the final design. After that, construction would take at least five years to complete. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOfficials said the new highway could open in phases, with the middle, rural section opening first. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highway will be 18 kilometres long, two lanes in each direction separated by a 22-metre grass median. It includes three major water crossings, 25 other structures over roads and water and seven interchanges. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nToday&#8217;s construction costs are estimated at $250 million. This will rise with inflation, and excludes costs to buy property for the route.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div align="center"><img src="/web/20100203145006/http://therecord.metrolandwest.com/images/assets/310843_4.JPG" border="0" alt="" /><br />\r\nSeries Website: <a href="/web/20100203145006/http://news.therecord.com/specialsections/section/highwayseven" target="_blank">/web/20100203145006/http://news.therecord.com/specialsec...n/highwayseven</a></div><br />\r\n<b><u>Series starts Saturday</u></b><br />\r\nAn in-depth series of articles on the highway that links Guelph to Kitchener begins Saturday in the Record and the Guelph Mercury.

This was ruled out because alternative routes are indirect, particularly in the south. Back roads would still be overwhelmed by traffic, even after upgrades. An expensive new crossing of the Grand would be required at Ottawa Street. And residents who live on the back roads would be even more constrained by traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src="/web/20100203145006/http://therecord.metrolandwest.com/images/assets/314084_3.JPG" border="0" alt="" /><br />\r\nCathy Wiebe works in Guelph, but lives in Kitchener and has commuted between the two cities for nine years. She says the drive is frustrating most of the time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cost of a new Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph has soared to $300 million, and may exceed $400 million by the time it\'s completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter 19 years of planning, this year the Ontario government approved the four-lane freeway to end bumper-to-bumper traffic and improve safety.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It\'s been put off for too damn long,&quot; Transportation Minister Donna Cansfield said. &quot;You can rest assured. That highway will be built.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new road -' + '- 18 kilometres long -' + '- will cut a 100-metre swath through the countryside, north of the current two-lane highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will displace five businesses and 11 homes. It will span the Grand River, bisect a wetland, and consume 144 hectares of farmland, affecting more than a dozen farms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highway will serve more than 19,000 people who commute daily between Kitchener and Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommuters have helped overwhelm the current highway, which carries at least 1,300 more vehicles per day than it can practically handle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEstimated costs have soared since planning began in 1989.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new Highway 7 would have cost just $89 million, if built in 1992. By 2002, the cost for the approved route was estimated at $160 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, the estimated cost reached $294 million, the Ministry of Transportation says. This includes construction, land acquisition and planning costs to date.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt this escalating pace, costs could exceed $400 million by 2014, the earliest projected completion date.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;That\'s ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous,&quot; said critic Elizabeth Wharton of the Westmount Environment Group in Waterloo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;For less than 10 minutes of travel time, and to put in a new highway?&quot; Wharton said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;All they would have to do is widen that existing highway. And that\'s all that\'s necessary, for a fraction of that cost.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCansfield would not predict a final Highway 7 bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new road is needed to meet future transportation needs, she contends, and to ease the economic cost of traffic congestion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The cost of not doing it is far greater than the cost of doing it,&quot; Cansfield said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We have to deal with the congestion and the gridlock and the economic impact that is having in this jurisdiction. And deal with it we will.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe province blames soaring costs on construction prices that are rising almost 12 per cent a year.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There have been substantial increases over the past few years to pavement and bridges, which are a major part of this project,&quot; said Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Bob Nichols.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConstruction costs for the new highway have soared from $147 million in 2002 to $256 million today. That\'s up 74 per cent in five years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCosts for reinforced concrete, up 83 per cent over five years, have added $49 million to the bill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEstimated costs to buy land have more than tripled, from $11 million in 2002 to $36 million today. Land acquisition is underway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHighway planners have rejected calls to widen the current two-lane road. They contend traffic between the cities is so great, it would overwhelm such a road by 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It was determined that only a freeway would accommodate the predicted traffic demand beyond 2028,&quot; Nichols said. &quot;Widening the current highway would have significant impacts to businesses, and disruption to properties.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere\'s what you\'ll get when the freeway is finished, planners predict.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou\'ll be able to drive 18 kilometres between Kitchener and Guelph in under 11 minutes, without a traffic light to slow you down.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCars will no longer back up at intersections for several green lights, in stop-and-go traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highway will not see congestion until well past 2028. The current highway, now overwhelmed during rush hours, will also open up as traffic shifts to the new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlanners say the new highway will be safer than the current highway, which claims on average one life per year. That\'s because drivers will face no bothersome driveways, and there will be less risk of colliding with an opposing vehicle.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe speed limit will be 100 km/h and the freeway will include four lanes, divided by a grassy median 22 metres wide. If expansion to six lanes is ever needed, extra lanes would be built in this median.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Kitchener, the new highway will be dominated by a massive freeway-to-freeway interchange, soaring above Wellington Street.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBeneath it, a remodelled local interchange will provide access to the Conestoga Parkway, after consuming some businesses and industrial lands bordering the parkway today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt will be the biggest interchange in this part of Ontario, a tower of concrete and motion that will stack four levels of traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;For guys that love building bridges, that\'s a dream come true,&quot; said Malcolm Matheson, president of Steed and Evans, a highway construction firm. &quot;That would be very technically difficult, very challenging to do.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\'s estimated the Kitchener interchange, costing $64 million today, will consume 25 per cent of highway construction costs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere will be six other interchanges on the way to Guelph, where the new Highway 7 will meet the Hanlon Expressway. Reaching Guelph will require spanning the Grand River, Hopewell Creek, Ellis Creek, and 11 smaller watercourses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe most costly section of the new highway is where it spans the Grand River, between Wellington Street and Ebycrest Road. This portion, to cost $78 million today, is estimated at 30 per cent of highway costs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highway will include 27 structures, including ramps, bridges, overpasses and underpasses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government has said construction will not start before 2010, and will take at least five years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCansfield hopes the new highway will be completed before 2014, the earliest projected date.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We\'re actually fast-tracking a lot of activities on this particular project,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<font color="red"><b><u><font size="3">HIGHWAY BUILDING ON A MASSIVE SCALE</font></u></b></font><br />\r\n<br />\r\nGraders will have to move 3.6 million cubic metres of earth to lay the foundation for a new highway linking Kitchener and Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\'s enough dirt to fill the Rogers Centre in Toronto two times, with some left over.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe highway base and shoulders will consume almost 1.2 million tonnes of gravel. This will fill more than 52,000 regular-size dump trucks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaving the highway will consume 329,000 tonnes of asphalt. This is more than four times the asphalt used each year by Waterloo regional government on major local roads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuilding 27 structures such as bridges and flyovers will consume 49,000 cubic metres of formed concrete, reinforced by steel bars. This is the biggest part of highway costs, at $108 million today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would take Waterloo regional government 100 years to use this much concrete on local roads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe huge quantities involved in building a new highway are no surprise to Malcolm Matheson, president of Steed and Evans, a Kitchener construction firm.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This is the first major, new piece of highway in this area, I believe, since the expressway,&quot; he said, referring to the Conestoga Parkway built by Kitchener and Waterloo in the 1960s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMatheson expects his company will bid for Highway 7 work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA planning study recommends the new highway open in three stages. This has not been finalized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe construction timeline has also not been finalized. It would not begin before 2010 at the earliest, the Ministry of Transportation has said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government says it needs at least three more years to finalize designs and acquire land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCompleting the new highway would take at least five years. If stages are not built concurrently, completion could take as long as 10 years. This puts the earliest completion at 2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe approved highway planning study recommended that:<br />\r\n<ul><li>The central stage be opened first, between Ebycrest Road and Guelph\'s Elmira Road. This stage could take two to three years to complete. The estimated cost is $95 million in 2007.</li>\n<li>The western stage, between Wellington Street in Kitchener and Ebycrest Road, would take four to five years to complete. The estimated cost today is $142 million.</li>\n<li>The eastern stage, between Elmira Road to Highway 6 in Guelph, would take two years to complete.

Luxton sits on her car at the shoulder of Highway 7. Luxton commutes to Guelph every day, but takes back roads to avoid highway congestion.</div><br />\r\nTraffic is so bad on Highway 7 it scares drivers away.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCountry roads between Kitchener and Guelph are filled with motorists fleeing gridlock. They speed on rural roads and on gravel roads, seeking the holy grail of commuting -' + '- a miraculous backdoor route between the cities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt does not exist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut this does not stop them from searching. Because at least the search keeps you moving.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis feels better to many commuters than idling in traffic, staring at the bumper ahead, gripping the wheel in frustration, or in fear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.A. Luxton has been driving from her Kitchener home to her Guelph job for 32 years. It used to take 22 minutes, but now takes up to 40.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You just have to gear back everything,&quot; she says. &quot;That can be frustrating, if you\'re needing to be somewhere.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few years ago, Luxton switched to back roads, to avoid new traffic signals at Highway 7 intersections.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I\'m not saying they\'re not needed,&quot; she says. &quot;But it slowed it dramatically, the minute those lights went in.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, her favoured route to Guelph takes her through Bridgeport, Maryhill and Marden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis helps her avoid drivers who, once in a while, try to pass long lines of Highway 7 traffic. &quot;It\'s a very dangerous highway,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCathy Wiebe has been commuting from her Kitchener home to her job in Guelph for nine years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Most of the time I\'m frustrated,&quot; she says. &quot;I\'m trying to relax, and know that this is just the reality.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe drives Highway 7 part way, but switches to back roads closer to Guelph. &quot;I just know, turn left here, turn right here, and I can jog my way around,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWiebe is not persuaded that driving back roads speeds her commute. But she finds it hard to sit in traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I\'d much rather be driving than sitting and fretting about, \'How long is this going to take?\' &quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost days she spends an hour commuting in her car. She listens to radio traffic reports, and needs to leave work in a hurry, to avoid the worst traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA faster, easier commute would soothe her frustration with heavy traffic. It would make it easier for her to stay later at work, but would also free up more time to spend with her family.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I have kids at home. So the more time I could spend with them, that would be a benefit,&quot; Wiebe says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandra Hanmer often takes back roads to avoid Highway 7 congestion between her Waterloo home and Guelph job. &quot;You keep moving,&quot; she says. &quot;I don\'t like standing still. I do like to know that I\'m moving.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe\'s persuaded it\'s a bad idea for the government to let commuters stew in heavy traffic. &quot;We need something that will carry the amount of traffic,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;People are making choices to either live and work in various locations, and we should be encouraging that, as we can. It helps the economies of both areas.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nConsider yourself lucky, if you live in Guelph and commute to Waterloo Region. You\'re on the lighter side of the Highway 7 traffic flow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes, traffic going the other way is bumper-to-bumper between the cities in rush hour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I would not want to be doing that,&quot; says Doug Campbell of Guelph. &quot;It\'s brutal.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I just keep thanking my lucky stars I\'m not in that lineup, going the other way,&quot; says Angela Davis, of Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 2001 census found 11,500 people commuting into Guelph from Waterloo Region, and 7,600 commuting into the region from Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommuter traffic has helped overwhelm the highway, which carries at least 1,300 more vehicles per day than it can practically handle, between Kitchener and Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCampbell has been commuting to Kitchener for 15 years, Davis for 17 years, and Kathie Lamie for five years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll say they sometimes drive back roads, to get off Highway 7 for at least part of the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;You move steadily and it\'s quite beautiful, to go through the country roads,&quot; says Lamie, who lives east of Guelph. &quot;You feel like you\'re getting to your destination, instead of sitting and waiting.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDavis remembers when Highway 7 felt different years ago.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Originally, it just seemed like a not bad drive out in the country, between two cities,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Now, it\'s definitely got that sort of anxiety of a commute to it. Just that tension, that there\'s lots of cars around you, that it\'s just car after car after car, and people just focused on getting where they are going. And I notice people doing all kinds of crazy things.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCampbell and Lamie say they can live with the current highway. But they understand why people commuting from Kitchener are clamouring for a better road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There\'s no question it needs to be improved or widened,&quot; Campbell says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDavis agrees. &quot;There has to be a better flow of traffic between the two cities,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It really is way too dangerous. And it uses up way too much of people\'s time, sitting there like that.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn average, Highway 7 claims one life per year between the borders of Guelph and Kitchener, and injures 27 more, according to the Ministry of Transportation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\'s a grim human toll, but not a surprising outcome. This is about the expected collision rate for a two-lane rural highway with its level of traffic, provincial figures show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGovernment officials contend the new highway will be safer. That\'s because on average, collisions fall 25 per cent on freeways where there are no driveways and opposing traffic is separated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There have been collisions on that highway, and some of them have resulted in deaths,&quot; Transportation Minister Donna Cansfield said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Have there been an extraordinary number? No, not in comparison to some other parts of the province.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;But having said that, I always think one collision that results in any fatality is one too many. And we need to be able to do what we can.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPolice say the approved freeway will be better for officers to patrol and commuters to drive. &quot;It will be a huge improvement, safety-wise and for the flow of traffic,&quot; said Const. Mark Cloes, of the Wellington OPP.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCommuters say most drivers have figured out how to drive Highway 7 safely.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think most people who regularly travel 7, know where it slows down, know where it\'s going to speed up, and have developed a patience with it,&quot; Sandra Hanmer says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe biggest threat is when someone tries to pass a long line of cars without the space to do so. &quot;People will do that. They will take those chances,&quot; Cathy Wiebe says. &quot;I wouldn\'t do that myself. It\'s not worth the risk.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPassing often gains no advantage. &quot;You end up stopping at a light somewhere, and they\'re beside you,&quot; Angela Davis says. &quot;So, how much farther ahead did they really get?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFred Wagner, a Maryhill farmer, often gets the middle-finger salute from irked motorists, when he takes his slow-moving farm equipment onto the highway. &quot;I\'m sick of that, quite frankly,&quot; he says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOccasionally, an impatient driver will even pass him on the inside, one wheel on gravel, one wheel in the ditch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;They\'re lucky there\'s no mail box in the way and they make it,&quot; he says. &quot;But I mean, this is totally, totally ridiculous, how people try to kill themselves basically to go to work every day.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBreslau provides a tricky spot, where Highway 7 narrows to one lane, heading east out of Kitchener.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Everyone will race, to the point where it merges into one lane,&quot; Doug Campbell says. &quot;They\'re going breakneck. And they\'ll run the road right till it ends, almost. It\'s still a little disconcerting when it happens.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAngela Davis breathes easier when she gets past this tricky merge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;That one is really dangerous,&quot; she says. &quot;You see cars cutting each other off, and trying to pass trucks.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe sticks to the middle. &quot;I\'m very thankful when I get through that spot,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou may think the solution to Highway 7 congestion is to let commuters flee to the back roads. Highway neighbours disagree.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTheir peace and quiet is disrupted by motorists whizzing by on roads never built to handle the traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Commuters are probably the worst drivers,&quot; Wagner says. &quot;They drive 120 on the township roads. That\'s not what those roads were built for. . .<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We have kids standing out there waiting for the school buses, or getting off-loaded. We have farm equipment on the road. We have local traffic. We have people walking on the streets for their exercises,&quot; he said. &quot;All that stuff is a safety concern.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYears ago, Al Cassidy would see maybe 10 cars a day drive past his house on Spitzig Road. &quot;Now it\'s a constant stream,&quot; he says. &quot;There\'s a lot more traffic. You talk to anybody that lives there. And faster traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;People are frustrated when they come off the highway, and they\'re trying to make time up.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn east Kitchener, it\'s estimated Bridgeport sees up to 7,000 vehicles a day that are fleeing Highway 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis has helped build a major bottleneck at the overwhelmed intersection of Bridge and Lancaster streets. Traffic is so heavy in rush hours that planners have capped Bridgeport growth for more than a decade.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen a new highway is built, it\'s estimated Bridgeport will shed 35 per cent of its bothersome traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf built today, the new Highway 7 would cost $300 million. It may cost $400-million-plus when completed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLuxton opposes the new road, even though she avoids the current highway. &quot;It\'s a bad idea, bad concept, bad thinking,&quot; she says. &quot;I do not agree with all the farmland being ripped to shreds.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe proposes widening the current highway to four lanes, plus a turning lane in the middle. &quot;I think it could fit in there, without wrecking homes or buildings that have been there for years,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Transportation has rejected this option. Traffic is already so heavy, a wider Highway 7 would be overwhelmed by 2011, planners contend.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think that\'s their argument to make people feel as though they\'re incorrect,&quot; Luxton says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWiebe wonders too if a highway widening might be best. &quot;I would prefer to see the least amount of impact on the environment as possible,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, she\'s not deterred by the cost of a new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think that\'s a scary price tag,&quot; she says. But if building a new highway makes the road safer for everybody, and handles heavy traffic that\'s only going to get worse, she can see how everyone would benefit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I think they just need to make a decision and go,&quot; she says. &quot;Get it done.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf a new road is shown to be the best solution, to support traffic today and in the future, Sandra Hanmer can see it as a bill worth paying.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;The infrastructure always needs to, in my mind, be ahead of the growth, so that you can be growing into your infrastructure, rather than trying to catch up,&quot; she says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAngela Davis can also see herself supporting a new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Certainly, safety is uppermost,&quot; she says. &quot;Giving people access to get to their place of work is important.

And he\'s ready to wait years more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There would be demand tomorrow if it opened up,&quot; Armbruster said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nActiva Group, where Armbruster is a vice president, built 300 homes near Bridge and Lancaster streets -' + '- just north of Breslau, in the former town of Bridgeport -' + '- about five years ago. But apart from that subdivision and others approved years before, development in parts of the area has been frozen since 1996 when the region determined the intersection couldn\'t handle any more traffic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA large portion of the cars passing through there are people avoiding the congestion where Highway 7 enters Kitchener -' + '- about 30 per cent, according to Shahzad Rahman, a regional engineer working on improving traffic flow through Bridge and Lancaster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the most recent figures, gathered in February, about 2,000 cars pass through the intersection every hour in the morning rush, and almost 3,000 in the afternoon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite the development cap, continued growth of surrounding areas and a swell in commuters between Guelph and Waterloo Region means traffic has kept growing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new highway will open a swath of land for potential development in Waterloo Region. Development of the so-called eastside lands, about 3,700 hectares in the area of the airport, likely won\'t happen for decades. But the highway will provide essential access for development by the time the region has outgrown its current footprint, said Kevin Curtis, a planner with Waterloo Region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If there\'s no new highway, you couldn\'t accommodate the same level of development,&quot; Curtis said. &quot;Without it, you couldn\'t use the area to its fullest extent.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe eastside lands lie south of the new highway, between the Grand River and Shantz Station Road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlanning for that development is very preliminary -' + '- the region is determining roughly where employment lands and homes should go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd it\'s all a long way off.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;In the present plan, the lands will remain rural until there\'s a need -' + '- for 30 or 40 or 50 years,&quot; said John Scarfone, a senior planner for Woolwich Township.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven then, the land north of the new highway would remain agricultural, he added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGrowth is already happening in Breslau, where some of 900 approved housing units are being built. And areas along Shantz Station are being commercialized.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Anything outside that will remain rural for the foreseeable future,&quot; Scarfone said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\'s a different story on the eastern end of the highway, in Guelph and Wellington County. The area is surrounded by industrial land and unlikely to see much residential development. But when the new highway joins up with the Hanlon Expressway, it will create opportunity for more industry and employment lands, said Lyle McNair, president of the Guelph and District Real Estate Board.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe area most affected by the eastern end of the new highway is in Wellington County, and county politicians say they\'re not expecting much change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut the planned highway is already having ripples in the area. The Guelph Golf Academy, a nine-hole course on the northeast corner of the existing highway and Townline Road in Guelph-Eramosa Township, has been discussed for years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was on hold until the province finalized the highway alignment. When that happened in March, the golf course got the green light.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExperience has shown it\'s unlikely rural lands around the highway will remain undeveloped, said David Douglas, a planning professor at the University of Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;There will be enormous pressure&quot; to develop along the new highway, he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If a decision has been made (to build a new highway), then putting in appropriate land-use controls will be imperative -' + '- that the highway is just for highway purposes, not the wedge for strip development from Guelph to Waterloo.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b><font color="blue"><font size="4">Wetlands, farms paved over</font></font></b><br />\r\nMinistry redrew route to reduce the destruction of sensitive areas<br />\r\nOctober 01, 2007 <br />\r\nJEFF OUTHIT, RECORD STAFF<br />\r\n<a href="/web/20100203145006/http://news.therecord.com/article/249720" target="_blank">/web/20100203145006/http://news.therecord.com/article/249720</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src="/web/20100203145006/http://media.therecord.topscms.com/images/0c/8f/b054f5f74d34a8a64d35eee02e27.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />\r\nEd Koch, owner of the Troika horse farm, holds Claudia Cardinale with trainer, Vivian Millard.

It will consume eight hectares of wetland, skirting several wetlands and fragmenting one near Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is less environmental damage than feared. The highway as originally planned would have consumed up to 20 hectares of wetlands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFacing outcry, planners shifted the approved route, to avoid a wetland north of Bridge Street in Kitchener, to skirt rather than bisect other wetlands, and to streamline the crossing of Hopewell Creek.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new route causes &quot;minimal&quot; damage to the environment, Transportation Minister Donna Cansfield contends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It actually reduces the number of crossings along the creeks, and it reduces the impact on the Grand River as a whole,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If there\'s further modifications we could make that would actually impact it less, we\'re open to that.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnvironmentalists are unimpressed. They note that wetlands are important natural areas that help recharge underground water supplies, while supporting wildlife.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;They are also places for special animals, like frogs and all kinds of amphibians that live in the wetlands, and birds that are partial to the wetlands,&quot; Folzer said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCritics cite lost farmland as a major concern. &quot;We need our agricultural land,&quot; Wharton said. &quot;We want to eat locally. And how are we going to eat locally if we keep chewing up our farmland?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAffected landowners react differently to the new highway plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAl Cassidy has already sold his three-hectare hobby farm on Spitzig Road to the province, because it\'s in the way of the new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNegotiating the land sale, and dealing with years of highway uncertainty, has taken its toll. &quot;It\'s been an exhaustive process,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, he has seen enough of the current highway to know that it is overwhelmed. Building a new highway strikes him as the best solution, to meet community transportation needs over the long term.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It\'s a necessity,&quot; Cassidy said. &quot;We have no sour grapes over it, having to lose our house. Somebody has to.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWagner is poised to lose 13 hectares of rented land that he farms between Spitzig and Shantz Station roads. The new highway will also saddle him with pie-shaped lots that will be more difficult to farm than square parcels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, he figures a new road will reduce traffic on the current highway, making it safer for farm equipment to travel. He also expects it will keep commuters off local roads, which are filled with drivers fleeing Highway 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It\'s one of those investments that should have been made long ago, in infrastructure, and would have been probably worthwhile for the whole neighbourhood,&quot; Wagner said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHorse farmer Ed Koch expects the new highway will require up to three hectares of his property on Shantz Station Road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe\'s mostly concerned about a proposal to also build a new laneway through his farm. It\'s meant to access a neighbouring property that will be left landlocked by the new road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKoch worries the laneway will be a safety hazard, because it will pass too close to unpredictable horses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I will fight that if I have to go to the Supreme Court,&quot; Koch said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKoch has been bothered for years by uncertainty about Highway 7 plans. &quot;It\'s frustrating,&quot; he said. &quot;How can you run a business if you don\'t know if you have to tear down some buildings, possibly?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe doubts a new road is the solution to gridlock. &quot;Common sense tells me, add another two lanes to the existing one,&quot; Koch said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe province contends a widened highway would be overwhelmed by traffic by 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Elmira Road, near Guelph, Trevor Vanderpol is tired of fighting the province over his threatened farm. &quot;It\'s been going on a long time already&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanderpol owns 31 hectares that his brother uses to grow wheat, soy and corn. He figures the new highway may take up to a quarter of the farm he grew up on.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanderpol contends planners have underestimated the environmental diversity of the Marden wetland behind his house. It will be fragmented by the new road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe\'s also upset the highway route was changed after 1997, to come much closer to his house.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis was done, he contends, to increase industrial acreage on the Guelph side of the new highway, and to appease businesses that lobbied against widening the current highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;They\'re going to be just left peachy, and everyone else takes a hit,&quot; Vanderpol said. &quot;I get all the negatives.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe government has yet to make an offer for his land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanderpol says he\'s lodged complaints with various government agencies but has been rebuffed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow, he does not know if he should invest in the repair and maintenance of his property. &quot;It just brings so much uncertainty,&quot; he says.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Transportation estimates the government will spend $36 million to buy the land it needs for the new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCansfield contends the route strikes a balance, limiting damage to farms and the environment, while meeting transportation needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We don\'t take people\'s lands.

Traffic on Highway 7 moves briskly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe road is no longer swamped with cars. Instead, people travel easily from their homes in Guelph to workplaces in Kitchener and vice versa on a modern, integrated transit system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack in 2007 -' + '- when, for a time, there had been plans for a new Highway 7 costing hundreds of millions of dollars -' + '- about 20,000 commuters travelled Highway 7 daily. But even as the area has continued to grow, that number has dropped.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThousands of people a day in Guelph and Waterloo Region are getting up around 7:30 a.m. and having a leisurely breakfast before heading out the door. There\'s no need to check a bus schedule -' + '- a short walk from home, a bus arrives every 15 minutes and whizzes them to the train station downtown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere, an individual, diesel-propelled rail car awaits them. Because these cars are small, seating 80 or 90 passengers, they\'re able to run often -' + '- every 15 minutes or so. And the ride takes just long enough to have a coffee -' + '- sold on board -' + '- read the morning\'s news or fire off a few e-mails.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the other end, commuters wait no more than 15 minutes for a connecting bus or train that takes them near their workplace.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey get to work unfrazzled by the stress of automobile traffic, without having to worry about parking or the fluctuating price of gas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd there are plenty of other incentives to take transit. It\'s cheap -' + '- in fact the whole thing was free for the first month or two, to give people a chance to try it out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA single ticket gets them from home to work. Advertising is aggressive -' + '- schedules are posted around the downtown and appear regularly in the newspaper.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat world seems far away. But it\'s the type of scenario envisioned by public transit advocate Paul Langan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA 2006 study spearheaded by cities between London and Toronto -' + '- including Guelph and Waterloo Region -' + '- said that for a startup cost of less than $80 million, train service between London and Union Station in Toronto could be bumped up to seven peak-direction trains a day -' + '- four more than currently run along that route.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRunning that service would cost $3.5 million a year -' + '- an amount more than offset by revenues projected between $5 million and $10 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would be set up in stages, with the Toronto-to-Breslau piece put in within the first five or 10 years at a cost of nearly $20 million, and the rest to follow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat service would mean fewer cars on the road -' + '- including Highway 7. But it\'s not enough to get commuters efficiently between Guelph and Kitchener because traffic on that corridor moves in both directions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDetermining how much a commuter service would cost is a difficult proposition. Price tags vary significantly depending on things like the sort of technology that\'s used and the lay of the land.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTen years ago, a consultant hired by the province dismissed the idea of rail transit between Guelph and Kitchener as too expensive and unlikely to attract enough passengers to significantly decrease congestion on the highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt the time, provincial experts figured a new Highway 7 would cost about $90 million, compared to $140 million to $160 million for rail. The idea of bus transit wasn\'t even considered, with consultants arguing that because the buses would travel on the same congested road as cars, they wouldn\'t attract enough riders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut now that the new road has a price tag of something like $300 million -' + '- which could grow to $400 million by the time it\'s built -' + '- perhaps it\'s time to go shopping again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe province\'s study of Highway 7 focused on the rail option.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBus rapid transit is another common mode -' + '- one that was dismissed by the province. But dedicated transit lanes have been built in municipalities around the country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBus projects are cheaper to build, but often more expensive to run because they require more drivers and transport fewer people, says Jeff Casello, a civil engineering professor at the University of Waterloo. Bus projects are also easily adjusted to demand -' + '- it\'s just a matter of running buses more or less frequently. And there are more options to how it can run -' + '- anything from permanent bus-only lanes, lanes that are bus-only during peak periods, to lanes that merge with regular traffic in less congested areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBus service is generally established in new markets, and later upgraded to rail if demand is high enough, said Daniel Francey, acting manager of planning and development for GO Transit, one of the province\'s biggest providers of commuter transit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThose services generally start on regular highway lanes, and move to specialized lanes only when there\'s too much congestion on the highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of the most efficient bus transit systems exist in Curitiba, Brazil, where a bus system transports 1.3 million passengers a day, and Bogota, Colombia, where the buses take 45,000 people an hour in each direction during rush periods.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there are functioning bus rapid transit systems in York Region, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCosts of various transit systems are hard to compare -' + '- depending on things like whether new roads need to be built, how fast the buses can travel and what kind of buses are needed. A rapid bus service generally costs about half of light rail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaterloo Region is currently pondering rapid transit options. Based on the region\'s estimates, the overhead for a commuter bus service along the length of Highway 7 would be between $12 million and $530 million -' + '- depending largely on whether buses run in a dedicated lane -' + '- plus roughly $10 million for buses.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat\'s compared to the region\'s estimate of between $500 and $850 million for light rail -' + '- a number that eclipses the $300 million expected cost of the new Highway 7. The same report suggests the cost of transit advocate Langan\'s idea of single, self-propelled diesel rail cars would cost in the range of $300 to $840 million.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCasello argues potential savings are to be had on rail. Running trains on the existing freight lines could reduce the price of light rail between the two cities by more than $100 million. That, though, would limit how often trains can run, and could make them less reliable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLangan argues transit systems are often set up to fail.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We have to look at transit as a significant concern and the problem of moving people from A to B instead of building a giant highway and throwing on a few buses,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe said the problem begins with people talking about transit losing money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;With sewers, you don\'t say \'Am I losing money?\' How much does the road lose?&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaking transit work is going to take a big conceptual shift to overcome decades of road building, he said, calling the building of big freeways like Highway 401 &quot;the biggest failed experiment ever.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div align="center"><b><font size="4"><font color="blue">HANLON HOPES</font></font></b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src="/web/20100203145006/http://therecord.metrolandwest.com/images/assets/316395_3.JPG" border="0" alt="" /><br />\r\n<u>HANLON IMPROVEMENTS LEGEND</u><br />\r\nBlack circle - Existing full interchange<br />\r\nRed circle - Full interchange<br />\r\nHalf red circle - Partial interchange (to/from South)<br />\r\nRed lines - flyover<br />\r\nRed x - Intersection to be closed after adjacent interchange is in place</div><br />\r\nA new Highway 7 will likely act as an alternate route to Highway 401 for people living in Waterloo Region.

Others have been on the table for years, with no road yet to show for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCounty Road 124 from Guelph to Cambridge: Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Bob Nichols points out this is not a provincial highway. But it used to be, until the Mike Harris government downloaded responsibilities for the road to Wellington County in 1996. Before that, discussions of expansion went on for years. In 1992, the province started a study of costs and impacts of building a four-lane highway, and said construction could begin within five to 10 years. Project manager Jim Horton said at the time that parts of the road have twice the number of accidents as similar roads, and argued the expansion is long overdue. In 1993, the province chose a route, and little else happened until the road was downloaded. In the process, the province gave Wellington County the environmental assessment on the expansion, along with an estimated $40-million price tag -' + '- in early 1990s dollars -' + '- for building a new road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHighway 24 from Brantford to Cambridge: As far back as 2004, local mayors were discussing the need for a better highway link between Brantford and Cambridge. There was discussion of putting in a 400-style highway. A preliminary plan exists to widen the road to four lanes and improve transit and rail connections with the GTA and Hamilton. The area is under study, and the province expects that study to be done in a year and a half.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProposed expansion to Highway 401 through Waterloo Region: discussion on this started at least in 2000.

It\'s estimated the final cost could exceed $400 million by 2014, the earliest projected completion date.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoffitt blames soaring costs on politicians who &quot;dithered too long&quot; before approving the new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This isn\'t rocket science stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;We\'ve built highways before, and we\'re at the stage where it needs to be built.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHarris said traffic on the current highway stunts economic growth by making it harder to get employees and goods in and out of the region.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We need this highway,&quot; said John Milloy, Liberal MPP for Kitchener Centre. &quot;In order to continue to grow, and continue with our prosperity, we need a good transportation infrastructure.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMilloy is not dissuaded by rising costs. &quot;I think to put if off because of costs would make no sense,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;This highway has been a necessity now for a number of years,&quot; agrees Elizabeth Witmer, Progressive Conservative MPP for Kitchener-Waterloo.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It\'s a matter of safety, and it\'s a matter of making sure that it contributes to the flow of traffic and the growth of the economy,&quot; she said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If we don\'t go ahead now, the cost will continue to escalate.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMark Cairns, New Democrat candidate in Kitchener-Conestoga, said the approved route will do the least damage to the environment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCairns and Moffitt favour more public transit between the cities as well. &quot;You can get from Paris to Moscow with public transit,&quot; Cairns said. &quot;You can\'t even go from city to city in Ontario.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGreenwood-Speers, who commutes on Highway 7 to her job in Guelph, also favours better rail transit, to get commuters out of their cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe wants the current highway widened, not replaced.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ministry of Transportation has rejected widening the current highway, saying traffic would overwhelm it by 2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBusiness leaders say a Highway 7 freeway is needed to support economic growth and improve safety.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We have strong economic integration between the two communities, and we see that growing,&quot; said Todd Letts, president of the Greater Kitchener Waterloo Chamber of Commerce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLetts has been involved in just one collision in three decades of driving, and it was on Highway 7. &quot;It\'s a major quality-of-life risk, the risk that businesspeople and employees and the general public are taking on that road, on a regular basis,&quot; he said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current highway claims one life per year, on average, and injures 27 more. Its collision rate is about average for a highway of its kind.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe freeway is expected to be safer because freeways suffer 25 per cent fewer collisions, on average, than two-lane rural highways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLinamar Corporation, which makes auto parts in Guelph, expects a new Highway 7 to improve the &quot;very unpleasant&quot; commute endured by many employees who live in Kitchener and Waterloo. &quot;Easier passage will help our existing KW employees experience a safer, more pleasant commute, and also possibly attract additional talent to Linamar previously unwilling to make the journey each day,&quot; said Linda Hasenfratz, chief executive officer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIan Smith, president of the Guelph Chamber of Commerce, wonders if widening the current highway makes more sense. &quot;I\'m not convinced that a brand-new 400-series highway is needed, necessarily,&quot; Smith said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;For $300 million, we could do a lot,&quot; he said. &quot;We could get the Hanlon (Expressway) fixed, and widen the existing Highway 7 to four lanes, and kill two birds with one stone, for the same price tag.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll municipal councils on the route have endorsed the new highway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;We needed it a long time ago,&quot; Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr said. &quot;It\'s not just a matter of convenience for people being able to get between the two cities in a shorter period of time. It\'s unsafe.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGuelph MPP Liz Sandals is pleased her government has committed to the new road. &quot;It hasn\'t progressed so far that a different government couldn\'t cancel it,&quot; she warned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome candidates see the promise of a new highway as a political move by the Liberal government.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I wonder if it really will happen,&quot; said Polley of the Green Party in Guelph. &quot;It sounds like politicking just prior to an election.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransportation Minister Donna Cansfield said she understands why people might be skeptical, after 19 years of planning. &quot;I would be just as skeptical,&quot; she said. &quot;We have a firm commitment to this highway to get it completed. And it will be completed.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSandals said the government had to delay approval for at least a year, to consult with native groups. The timing of Highway 7 approval this year &quot;had nothing to do with provincial elections, trust me,&quot; she said.\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			\r\n\r\n\r\n		</div>\r\n			\r\n\r\n                        	\r\n		        \r\n			\r\n			<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><a href="showthread.php?t=116" rel="nofollow" title="Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116"><font color="Green"><font size="2"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Kitchener &amp; Nominate our Other Municipalities </b></font></font></a></div></blockquote>\r\n			\r\n\r\n			\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="postfoot">\r\n		<div class="textcontrols">\r\n			<span class="postcontrols">\r\n				<img style="display:none" id="progress_300" src="images/misc/progress.gif"  alt="" />\r\n				\r\n\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<a id="qrwq_300" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=300" rel="nofollow" ><img id="quoteimg_300" src="images/buttons/trans_40b.png" alt="Reply With Quote" /> Reply With Quote</a>\r\n					<span class="seperator">&nbsp;</span>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</span>\r\n\r\n			<span class="postlinking">\r\n				\r\n					\r\n				\r\n				\r\n\r\n				 \r\n				\r\n\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					 \r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n			</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n  ';

This exceeds all commuters to Toronto and to the regions of Peel, Halton and York.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSince 1996, commuting to Wellington has soared 54 per cent. If you add the reverse commute (Wellington residents heading to jobs here), there are 21,945 people travelling between the communities every working day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany drive Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph, which at rush hour is more like a parking lot. Others flee the overwhelmed highway for country roads that were never designed to carry them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs commuter traffic grows, it\'s galling that Ontario is taking forever to replace Highway 7.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA new freeway, studied since 1989, finally got the green light last year. Detailed design work is underway, but construction is not expected before 2010.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new freeway will take at least five years to build, costing at least $300 million and possibly more than $400 million by completion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\'s another notable revelation about commuters in the 2006 census. The long drive into the Greater Toronto Area on Highway 401 has flatlined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe latest census found 10,665 residents heading to jobs in Peel, Toronto, Halton and York. That\'s up from 10,345 commuters in 2001, a minor increase of just three per cent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMany local politicians don\'t want this region to become a bedroom community for greater Toronto. This does not seem to be happening with any vigour.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe local economy, it appears, has been providing jobs to keep residents at home. In fact, it\'s luring more outsiders.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 2006 census found 5,155 residents of the Greater Toronto Area who commute to jobs here. While this is just half the flow from here to there, it\'s up 55 per cent since 2001.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere\'s now a better balance to the commuter flow between this region and greater Toronto.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind, these numbers are two years old and the economy has struggled since. But what happened to commuting patterns between 2001 and 2006 is good news.\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			\r\n\r\n\r\n		</div>\r\n			\r\n\r\n                        	\r\n		        \r\n			\r\n			<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><a href="showthread.php?t=116" rel="nofollow" title="Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116"><font color="Green"><font size="2"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Kitchener &amp; Nominate our Other Municipalities </b></font></font></a></div></blockquote>\r\n			\r\n\r\n			\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="postfoot">\r\n		<div class="textcontrols">\r\n			<span class="postcontrols">\r\n				<img style="display:none" id="progress_301" src="images/misc/progress.gif"  alt="" />\r\n				\r\n\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<a id="qrwq_301" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=301" rel="nofollow" ><img id="quoteimg_301" src="images/buttons/trans_40b.png" alt="Reply With Quote" /> Reply With Quote</a>\r\n					<span class="seperator">&nbsp;</span>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</span>\r\n\r\n			<span class="postlinking">\r\n				\r\n					\r\n				\r\n				\r\n\r\n				 \r\n				\r\n\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					 \r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n			</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n  ';

A carpool parking lot will be built at the site of the former Breslau hotel, 300 metres south of Highway 7. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe small gravel lot, just east of Kitchener, may open by next month. It will have space for 25 cars. The idea, proposed by regional Coun. Jim Wideman, is that commuters to Guelph can park there and share rides. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lot will be lit. It will be plowed in the winter. It will have a sign. There will be no other services, and no special security. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe lot is in the middle of the Breslau neighbourhood, at 41 Woolwich St. S. Planners say cars will be visible from the street. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt’s not known how many Highway 7 commuters will use the lot, if any. But there’s a large potential market. A 2006 survey found 3,700 residents of Kitchener, Waterloo, Wellesley and Woolwich who commute to Guelph jobs. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWaterloo regional council plans to operate the lot for a year, then decide if it’s worth continuing. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTaxpayers will spend about $55,000 to prepare it, mostly to install lights. It may cost $7,000 a year to maintain, mostly to clear snow. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat’s not chump change. But it won’t drain public coffers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe publicly-owned lot is too small to ease Highway 7 traffic. But a few commuters might find it useful. If it’s popular, planners can look for a bigger, better site. If not, it was worth trying. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe hope is that if commuters use it, the province can later be persuaded to add a carpool lot to the new Highway 7 that’s been approved, but not built, between Kitchener and Guelph. The new highway is planned to run just north of the current highway. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the current Highway 7, it’s being resurfaced in Kitchener, for more than four kilometres between Frederick and Fountain streets. That’s your stimulus dollars at work, over $4 million worth. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPaving is done only in the evenings, to limit traffic impacts. But curb repairs must be done during the day, the project manager says. This means closing curb lanes, outside the morning and afternoon rush hours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpect frustrating delays. Warning signs are up on the edges and on two major crossroads. Curb repairs may be completed within two weeks.
