  DATE: May 18, 2010 | Report: <a href="/web/20100529052953/http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca/web/region.nsf/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce/55EB9C720F0BE2B78525772300595BFD/$file/E-10-055.pdf?openelement" target="_blank">E-10-055</a><br />
  <br />
  RECOMMENDATION: THAT the Regional Municipality of Waterloo approve the construction of a three-lane modern roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street in conjunction with the proposed widening of Maple Grove Road from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road in the City of Cambridge.<br />
  <br />
  <b>SUMMARY:</b><br />
  The widening of Maple Grove Road from two (2) to four (4) lanes from Cherry Blossom Road to Hespeler Road in the City of Cambridge is currently programmed in the Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program to be completed in three (3) stages from 2010 to 2016. The first phase, from Cherry Blossom Road to approximately 150 metres west of Fountain Street, will be completed in 2010. The second phase, from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, is currently in the detailed design phase and is scheduled to be constructedin 2013. The third phase, from Speedsville Road to Hespeler Road, is currently scheduled to be constructed in 2016. The intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove is currently controlled by traffic control signals. Based on forecasted 2024 traffic volumes, the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street requires significant capacity improvements in order to provide an acceptable level-of-service for traffic operations. Options available to provide the required capacity improvements include: (i) Construct dual left-turn lanes on three (3) of the four (4) intersection approaches as well as a designated right-turn lane on all four (4) approaches or (ii) Construct a modern three-lane roundabout in lieu of traffic control signals. In accordance with Regional policy (adopted April 9, 2003), staff has undertaken an Intersection Control Study to make a comparative analysis of a modern roundabout and traffic control signals atthe intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Staff has also consulted with property owners abutting this intersection to present the options and to obtain feedback. Based on the results of technical studies, the current operating experience with the Region&#8217;s thirteen (13) roundabouts, input received from abutting property owners and staff observations at several multi-lane roundabouts in the United States, staff is recommending that the Region construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, currently scheduled for construction in 2013. The Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program includes funding of $7,900,000 in years 2010-2014 inclusive for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including improvements to the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. The estimated total capital cost to construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is $4,825,000 compared to an estimated total capital cost of $3,417,000 to construct a signalized intersection with dual leftturn lanes and channelized right-turn lanes; however, an overall lifecycle cost analysis (which includes the societal cost of accidents) has concluded that constructing a three-lane roundabout is recommended over constructing traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Based on this preliminary $4,825,000 cost estimate for the proposed roundabout, the total project budget of $7,900,000 for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road is sufficient to construct a modern three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road. Staff will reassess this total project budget requirement as part of the 2011 budget process.<br />
  <br />
  <b>REPORT:</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>1. Background</b><br />
  The widening of Maple Grove Road from two (2) to four (4) lanes from Cherry Blossom Road to Hespeler Road in the City of Cambridge is currently programmed in the Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program to be completed in three (3) stages from 2010 to 2016. The first phase, from Cherry Blossom Road to approximately 150 metres west of Fountain Street, will be constructed to base course asphalt level in 2010. The second phase, from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, is currently in the detailed design phase and is scheduled to be constructed in 2013. The third phase, from Speedsville Road to Hespeler Road, is currently scheduled to be constructed in 2016. The intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is currently controlled by traffic control signals. (Please refer to Appendix &#8220;A&#8221; for a Key Plan.) Recently completed traffic studies indicate that traffic volumes at this intersection are projected to increase from 24,000 vehicles per day in 2009 to 55,000 vehicles per day by 2024. In order to address this projected growth in traffic, the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street requires significant capacity improvements in order to provide an acceptable level-of-service for traffic operations. Options available to provide the required capacity improvements include: (i) Construct dual left-turn lanes on three (3) of the four (4) intersection approaches as well as a designated right-turn lane on all four (4) approaches or (ii) Construct a modern three-lane roundabout in lieu of traffic control signals. Please refer to Appendix &#8220;B&#8221; for a drawing of the conventional intersection design for this intersection with traffic control signals and to Appendix &#8220;C&#8221; for a drawing of a roundabout design for this intersection.<br />
  <br />
  <b>2. Comparison of Traffic Control Signals and a Modern Roundabout</b><br />
  In accordance with Regional policy (adopted April 9, 2003), staff has undertaken an Intersection Control Study (ICS) to make a comparative analysis of a modern roundabout and traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. In order to complete the ICS, a preliminary design was completed for the proposed roundabout in order to determine its required configuration, lane requirements, property impacts and construction cost. Based on projected traffic volumes, the roundabout requires two (2) lanes of traffic initially and three (3) lanes of traffic by 2018 to provide an adequate level-of-service for traffic operations. Since 2018 is only five (5) years beyond the proposed construction timing of 2013, staff has based the comparative analysis on constructing the roundabout initially with three (3) lanes in 2013 to avoid retrofit costs, which are estimated to be approximately $847,000, to widen the roundabout from two (2) to three (3) lanes in 2018. The results of the ICS comparing traffic control signals to a three (3) lane roundabout are summarized below. Estimated present value costs for each alternative have been calculated using  a 6% discount rate.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street<br />
  20-Year Cost Comparison and Overall Assessment of Traffic Control Signals and a Roundabout (Present Value)</b><br />
  Estimated Cost | Traffic Control Signals | Roundabout<br />
  Construction | $3,417,000 | $4,825,000<br />
  Maintenance (signals) | $22,000 | 0<br />
  Injury Crash Cost | $2,650,000 | $640,000<br />
  Additional Street lighting &amp; Annual Maintenance | $4,000 | $34,000<br />
  Total (Present Value) | $6,093,000 | $5,499,000<br />
  Expected Average Number of Injury Collisions Per Year | 7.70 | 1.86<br />
  Operational Performance in 2024 (based on forecast 2024 traffic volumes) | Level of Service (LOS) D | Level of Service (LOS) A<br />
  Overall Assessment | | Preferred<br />
  <br />
  Based on this assessment, the present value cost over a 20-year period of a three (3) lane roundabout is estimated to be $594,000 lower than the cost of conventional road improvements with traffic control signals. Additionally, a roundabout is expected to provide significantly improved traffic operational performance and reduced injury collision frequency and costs compared to traffic control signals. Based on this comparison, staff have assessed that a modern three (3) lane roundabout is preferred over traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road from operational, cost and safety perspectives. Staff notes that there is a high percentage of truck traffic on Maple Grove Road (approximately 16%). A three (3) lane roundabout would permit two heavy trucks (tractor-trailers) to pass through the roundabout side-by-side concurrently while using the full width of the three (3) available lanes.<br />
  <br />
  <b>3. Public Consultation</b><br />
  There are five properties that directly abut the proposed modern roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street. These properties are owned by:<br />
  i) Toyota Canada;<br />
  ii) Loblaw Properties Limited;<br />
  iii) D5D Developments;<br />
  iv) Camrock Developments Corporation; and<br />
  v) Simon Poladian.<br />
  The Region will need to acquire property from each of the abutting property owners in order to construct the proposed roundabout. Please refer to Appendix &#8220;C&#8221; for a drawing illustrating the proposed three-lane roundabout and the property acquisition required by the Region in order to construct the roundabout. All five property owners were contacted by Regional staff to arrange an individual meeting to view drawings of the proposed roundabout and to provide an opportunity for the property owners to ask questions and to provide feedback regarding the proposed roundabout. Staff met with representatives of Toyota Canada, D5D Developments and Camrock Developments. Despite numerous attempts, staff was not successful in arranging a direct meeting with Loblaw Properties Limited and Simon Poladian. Staff sent these two property owners a letter accompanied by a drawing of the proposed roundabout and requested that they provide any comments. To date, staff has not received a response from either property owner. The representatives of abutting properties that were able to meet with staff did not express any concerns with regard to the permanent implementation of a proposed three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street or the sale of required property to the<br />
  Region. Representatives of Toyota Canada expressed some concern regarding the impacts of construction of a roundabout on traffic movement through the intersection and the extent of expected delays during the construction period. Staff reviewed the proposed construction staging plans for the roundabout with each property representative. The construction staging plans will require the contractor to maintain one through lane of traffic in both directions and left-turn lanes on both Maple Grove Road and Fountain during construction. The proposed construction plan includes four separate stages. Please refer to Appendices &#8220;D1 to D4&#8221; for drawings of the proposed construction stages. Staff indicated to the property representative that some traffic delays during construction would be unavoidable; however, the representatives generally acknowledged that the proposed traffic staging should minimize the extent of traffic delays through the intersection during construction to the extent possible. Staff also noted that one lane of traffic in each direction would be maintained on Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street during construction of the road widening from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road. Staff also delivered approximately 325 letters on March 9, 2010 to area property owners along Maple Grove Road (from Highway 8 to Hespeler Road), Saltsman Drive (entire length), Cherry Blossom Road (entire length), Fountain Street (from Middle Block Road to Highway 401), Speedsville Road (from Middle Block Road to Highway 401), Beaverdale Road (from Middle Block Road to Hespeler Road), Allendale Road (Riverbank Drive to Fountain Street), Reuter Drive (entire length) and Royal Oak Road (entire length) advising them of all proposed improvements to Maple Grove Road from 2010 to 2016 including the consideration of a proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street. To date, staff has not received any inquiries or comments about a proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street as a result of this letter. Additionally, letters were sent on May 4, 2010 advising the five property owners abutting the proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street that the Region&#8217;s Planning and Works Committee will consider a staff report May 18, 2010 recommending the construction of a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street in conjunction with the proposed widening of Maple Grove Road from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road currently scheduled for construction in 2013.<br />
  <br />
  <b>5. Recommended Alternative</b><br />
  Based on the technical studies completed, the current operating experience with the Region&#8217;s 13 roundabouts, input received from the adjacent property owners that directly abut the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, and staff observations at several multi-lane roundabouts in the United States, staff believe the roundabout is a better option than traffic control signals for the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street because:<ul><li>The 20-year present value cost of a roundabout is less than traffic control signals;</li>
  <li>A roundabout is expected to result in fewer injury collisions and costs; and</li>
  <li>A roundabout is expected to result in fewer delays to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.</li>
  </ul>A roundabout would also result in fuel savings and a reduction in vehicle emissions. The proposed roundabout would also provide an opportunity for aesthetic streetscape enhancements that would not be possible with a signalized intersection. As projected traffic volumes warrant a three (3) lane roundabout in 2018, or five (5) years after the proposed timing for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road in 2013, staff is recommending that a three (3) lane roundabout be constructed initially in 2013 in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road.<br />
  <br />
  <b>CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN:</b> As part of the Region&#8217;s Strategic Focus, this project satisfies Focus Area 2: Growth Management, Manage and shape growth to ensure a livable, healthy, thriving and sustainable Waterloo Region, and Focus Area 1: Environmental Sustainability, Protect and enhance the environment by improving air quality and protecting the environment. The proposed roundabout would result in shorter queues and would therefore reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The proposed roundabout would also satisfy Focus Area 5: Infrastructure, Provide high quality infrastructure and asset management to meet current needs and future growth.<br />
  <br />
  <b>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:</b><br />
  The Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program includes funding of $7,900,000 in years 2010-2014 inclusive for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including improvements to the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. The estimated total capital cost to construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is $4,825,000 compared to an estimated total capital cost of $3,417,000 to construct a signalized intersection with dual leftturn lanes and channelized right-turn lanes; however, an overall lifecycle cost analysis (which includes the societal cost of accidents) has concluded that constructing a three-lane roundabout is recommended over constructing traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Based on this preliminary $4,825,000 cost estimate for the proposed roundabout, the total project budget of $7,900,000 for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road is sufficient to construct a modern three (3) lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road. Staff will reassess this total project budget requirement as part of the 2011 budget process. The source of funding for this project is the Development Charge Reserve Fund.

  					<font size="4"><font color="blue">Anxious councillors approve another roundabout</font></font> <br />
  May 18, 2010 | By Jeff Outhit, Record staff | <a href="/web/20100529052953/http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/713640" target="_blank">http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/713640</a><br />
   <br />
  WATERLOO REGION — Regional councillors have approved another roundabout even as critics of the traffic circles wonder if they’re nuts. <br />
   <br />
  “I can’t even enjoy my coffee at Tim Hortons any more, without someone stopping and saying ‘They’re putting 11 roundabouts on Franklin Boulevard. Do they know what they’re doing there?’” said Coun. Jane Brewer of Cambridge. <br />
   <br />
  The latest approval is for a three-lane roundabout at Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street in Cambridge. It’s planned for 2013 when Maple Grove Road is widened to four lanes. <br />
   <br />
  Regional councillors approved it Tuesday and then wondered: How come they keep hearing the same complaints, over and over, that roundabouts aren’t meant for big trucks or pedestrians? <br />
   <br />
  “Because it’s a change in how we do things, these questions keep coming up,” Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig said. “I think we need to answer that better.” <br />
   <br />
  Councillors agreed, directing staff to prepare another document or brochure explaining why roundabouts make sense for all vehicles and uses. They want the document to explore collision statistics for different users and explain how roundabouts reduce long-term injury costs. <br />
   <br />
  “We have to be careful that it’s not too technical,” said Coun. Claudette Millar of Cambridge.<br />
   <br />
  Councillors also agreed, at the urging of Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, to consider holding a philosophical debate on their long-term roundabout commitment.<br />
   <br />
  Regional council has installed 13 roundabouts on commuter roads since 2004 and has approved at least 18 more, on the assertion that traffic flows more smoothly and more safely through the circles. <br />
   <br />
  Local cities have built roundabouts on city streets and regional government has more roundabouts under review. <br />
   <br />
  This has put motorists on a sharp learning curve. Local results show roundabouts are generating more fender-benders but fewer injuries than signalized intersections.<br />
   <br />
  Roundabouts are designed so large trucks can straddle the lanes. Motorists are advised to wait and let trucks get through the circles. <br />
   <br />
  Coun. Jim Wideman, of Kitchener, estimates up to 80 per cent of drivers are OK with roundabouts but some critics will never be persuaded. “There are more believers than non-believers,” he said. <br />
   <br />
  He figures concerns about large trucks in the circles are often raised “as a stalling tactic” by critics who don’t want a roundabout.
