    				<b>Dynamic Downtown</b><br />
    <br />
    The contemporary new King Street streetscape creates both a visual and physical link between millions of dollars worth of new private sector developments in the downtown including: Kaufman Lofts, Civic Centre, the Tannery District, University of Waterloo's downtown Health Sciences Campus, Wilfrid Laurier University's Faculty of Social Work, a new regional courthouse, a redeveloped Centre Block and a new digital media centre.<br />
    <br />
    Designed to put pedestrians first, the new streetscape, along with these many exciting new downtown developments, is transforming King Street into a vibrant, urban, modern, environment full of creative energy—where the entrepreneurs, innovators and creators of tomorrow will live, work, learn and play.<br />
      	 <br />
    <br />
    <b>Festival Street</b><br />
    <br />
    Parades, festivals, ceremonies—when Kitchener celebrates, we celebrate on King—and now the community can celebrate in style. Curbs have been lowered, smaller event pads have been added, video projection has been installed high atop City Hall and in 2010, Civic Square will be expanded. Add these elements together and you've got a recipe for a premier community festival space.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_festival.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />
    <br />
    <b>Green Street</b><br />
    <br />
    Through public consultations, citizens were clear that it is important that King Street makes a statement about the community's concern for the environment.<br />
    <br />
    King Street was recently designated as a &quot;green street' by Tree Canada for its contribution to, and leadership in, creating an environmentally sustainable street design. A myriad of environmentally sustainable design features include: 120 new street trees; bike racks to encourage cycling; environmentally friendly planter beds that collect and filter storm water; use of recycled materials in the new roadway, recyclable benches and bollards; and improved waste management practices.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Wider Sidewalks</b><br />
    <br />
    New, wider sidewalks and gently sloping, lowered curbs improve pedestrian accessibility while contributing to the new sleek and contemporary design. In the warmer months, restaurants, coffee shops and retailers will spill out onto the new sidewalks while events and summer festivals can now enjoy much more outdoor, interactive space. Collectively, these popular, trendy, urban features will make downtown a more enriching and diverse experience.<br />
    <br />
    The new sidewalks add curb appeal for stores, restaurants and condo developments and are attractive to new developments looking to locate in the region.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_sidewalks.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />
    <br />
    <b>Brighter Nights</b><br />
    <br />
    New and contemporary street lighting, up-lighting in the street trees and other accent lighting now brightens up the street each evening. The new lighting—which offers two lights per pole—combined with brighter, more reflective sidewalks allows for higher and more even light levels at night, fewer and less pronounced shadows and reduced glare.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_brightlights.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />
    <br />
    <b>More Street Trees and Planter Beds</b><br />
    <br />
    Attractive, granite-clad planter beds spaced out throughout the three new blocks of King Street are multifunctional and serve as comfortable seating areas for pedestrians as well as helping to create a sustainable and green environment by collecting and filtering storm water before it enters the sewers.<br />
    <br />
    The planter beds also act as an enhanced growing environment for 120 new street trees—80 more than the number of trees that were once planted in this portion of the downtown. The street trees—carefully selected, hardy varieties—now have proper soil quality, irrigation and drainage so that they can continue to generate shade and contribute to air quality and an appealing environment for downtown visitors to enjoy.<br />
    	<br />
    <br />
    <b>Bike Racks and Street Furniture</b><br />
    <br />
    Cycling is a welcome alternative mode of transportation in the downtown. Everyone is welcome to use the additional bike racks that have been located throughout the three reconstructed blocks of King Street. If you're looking for a place to sit while you're out on a stroll on King or waiting to catch public transit, there will be additional benches and improved transit stops and shelters for your convenience.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_bikes.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div>  	 <br />
    <br />
    <b>Flexible Parking</b><br />
    <br />
    The new streetscape design incorporates the use of custom European-style bollards which provide the downtown with much more flexibility to accommodate the more than 320,000 people who annually attend downtown events and festivals.<br />
    <br />
    During the summer months when major events or street sales are occurring downtown, the bollards—freestanding, removable posts that delineate on-street parking spaces—can be used to close portions of the street to traffic or to convert on-street parking spaces into areas for outdoor cafes, patios and restaurant seating. During the winter months, the bollards can also be set to maintain on-street parking while still supporting a pedestrian-friendly environment.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_parking.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div>	<br />
    <br />
    <b>Speakers' Corners</b><br />
    <br />
    The reconstruction of King Street will breathe new life into this traditional community gathering place at the corner of King and Benton Streets. The corner is being enhanced with a contemporary look, added seating for visitors, more of the same street trees that you see along King, increased street lighting, sustainable planters and increased space for outdoor events.<br />
    <br />
    An intriguing and interactive public art installation—a tribute to anamorphic art which is based on photographs and is used to create visual illusions that entertain and delight viewers—will eventually complete the site.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-fall_speakerscorners.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div>  	 <br />
    <br />
    <b>Contemporary Design</b><br />
    <br />
    King Street will have some added colour and flair in the future, as new, modern light posts sport a wider variety of colorful banners advertising upcoming downtown events and festivals.<br />
    <br />
    A $1.23 million injection into the project from the federal government's Community Adjustment Fund enabled the city to enhance the street further with additions including further improved night lighting, more street trees, more benches and bicycle racks, new winter decorations for the area and new contemporary furnishings for Civic Square in front of City Hall.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingst_design.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div>		<br />
    <br />
    <b>Clean, Inviting Style</b><br />
    <br />
    Keeping the new street clean and free of garbage ensures that our downtown is a pedestrian friendly environment where residents, investors and shoppers will want to be. We will only be successful in keeping the street clean if we—the city, business owners and residents—work together.<br />
    <br />
    A new environmentally-friendly, deep-well garbage disposal system, which reduces trash overflow and odour, has been incorporated right into the new street. The bins, for use by both pedestrians and those businesses without rear access to garbage disposal bins, have been placed in six strategic locations along the newly reconstructed streetscape.<br />
    <div align="right"><img src="/web/20100523194128im_/http://www.downtownkitchener.ca/sites/cityofkitchener/images/2009-09kingstgarbage.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></div><br />
    <br />
    <b>Graffiti Resistant</b><br />
    <br />
    Graffiti is a common sight in many downtowns and Kitchener is no exception. To ensure that the new streetscape can be maintained and cleaned more easily should graffiti occur, all of the new sidewalks, planter bed cladding, light posts and bollards will be specially-treated with a protective sealant.

    <br />
    More bike paths and more landscaping, including up to 100 new trees for the core, are also planned.<br />
    <br />
    Work from College to Frederick streets will begin next spring.<br />
    <br />
    Coun. Berry Vrbanovic said it's been 25 years since changes have been made to King Street.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;The downtown is the heart of the city,'' he said yesterday. &quot;It's the first place visitors see. We want the downtown to be a place we can be proud of.''<br />
    <br />
    Other structural changes include movable bollards -- metal posts that can be quickly inserted into receptacles in the road surface -- to allow part of the street to be closed for outdoor festivals.<br />
    <br />
    Vrbanovic said revitalizing the downtown will attract more people to the already successful Kitchener Blues Festival and the K-W Multicultural Festival.<br />
    <br />
    The redesign is part of a push by the city to create a more people-friendly environment downtown and a more vibrant landscape.<br />
    <br />
    Last year, councillors were presented with four models. By spring, they'd chosen the &quot;pedestrian-first&quot; option.<br />
    <br />
    In this option, the downtown core will have bike racks, improved street lighting, distinct transit stops and lower curbs to make it easier to turn the street into a festival environment.<br />
    <br />
    Other features include solar-powered tree lights and stormwater planter beds, which absorb and filter rain water.<br />

    <b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">City commits $8.8M to make core more pedestrian-friendly</font></font></u></b><br />

    <br />
    KITCHENER - The makeover of the downtown stretch of King Street is back on after another $3 .2 million was added to the project's budget this week.<br />
    <br />
    City councillors increased the budget to about $8.8 million, up from an earlier estimate of $5.7 million.<br />
    <br />
    Tenders will be issued later this year for the work, which includes narrowing King Street, reducing the height of the curb, widening the sidewalks and adding more than 100 trees, decorative lamp posts and street furniture.<br />
    <br />
    When the reconstruction came to city councillors for approval in April, they balked at the higher than expected costs. But a $3.2 million grant from Queen's Park has now been rolled into the budget.<br />
    <br />
    The aim of the project is to transform King between Frederick and Francis into a pedestrian-oriented area that can easily be blocked off to cars for festivals. The estimated cost ranges from $9.7 million to $11.3 million.<br />
    <br />
    Cory Bluhm, the city's urban investment adviser, said the tenders will be designed so that less expensive materials can be used to keep the costs within the maximum budget of $8.8 million.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;One of the items would be the amount of specialized surface treatments, like granite, reducing the amount we would require or looking at similar materials that may be a little more cost effective,&quot; Bluhm said.<br />
    <br />
    New planters that allow rainwater to soak into the ground, new transit shelters and new bike racks will be installed. The area in front of City Hall will be better designed for major festivals, with accent lighting, caf?s, very low curbs and new trees.<br />
    <br />
    The project is proceeding with few changes to the original plans, Bluhm said. &quot;There are no major items we are removing, it's more scaling back in smaller detailed areas that would not impact the overall objective.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Construction schedules will not be set until the city consults with businesses along King Street. Whenever possible, the work will be done at times chosen by the business community so it won't suffer.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We are going in with no pre-conceived notions as to when exactly we would start until we know from them what their desires are,&quot; Bluhm said.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We suspect we would probably start at Speakers' Corner at Frederick Street and work toward City Hall, but until we get firm understanding from the business community we can't guarantee where we will start,&quot; Bluhm said.<br />
    <br />
    If construction starts this fall it could be finished in the fall of 2010.<br />

    RECORD STAFF<br />
    <br />
    KITCHENER - Construction is now scheduled to begin in April on a $7.6 million makeover of King Street from Frederick to Francis.<br />
    <br />
    Yesterday the city announced the successful bidder for the high-profile project is Steed and Evans Limited. During the next two years the sidewalks will be widened, the curbs lowered and the street narrowed. Under this pedestrian-first model the street can be easily blocked off for festivals.<br />
    <br />
    More planters to hold shade trees and new light standards will be put in place.<br />
    <br />
    The light standards will feature two 70-watt bulbs throwing lighting both on the sidewalk and the street.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;So we should get a nice, bright downtown,&quot; Mark Garner, the executive director of the Kitchener Downtown Business Association, said.<br />
    <br />
    Garner was happy to hear a contractor was selected and the delayed project was scheduled to begin next spring. &quot;It sounds great,&quot; he said.<br />
    <br />
    The work will be done in three phases between 2009 and 2011 with most of it scheduled for 2009 and 2010.<br />

    KITCHENER - <b>Work begins next month on a three-block stretch of King Street that will turn the downtown core into a construction zone until the end of August.</b><br />
    <br />
    The end result will be a pedestrian-oriented streetscape with wide sidewalks, a narrower roadway, cafés, benches, decorative lighting, tree planters and a city centre that can be easily blocked off to vehicles and turned over to people for events and festivals.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Construction will be staged in an effort to reduce the impact it will have on the businesses along that stretch of King Street</b>, said Eric Saunderson, the project manager.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We are continuing to work with the contractor to fine-tune and look at ways to accelerate and to get the work done as fast as reasonably possible,&quot; Saunderson said.<br />
    <br />
    But Mark Pettigrew, owner of Casablanca Books at 146 King St. W., wishes the city would pause the construction work during the months of June, July and August.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;That's our high season,&quot; Pettigrew said. &quot;This is going to affect our sales quite a bit.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    Thousands of people attend the Kitchener Blues Festival in August and Pettigrew sells more books during the festival than at any other time of the year.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We have stated our objections but it feels as though they are just not listening,&quot; Pettigrew said.<br />
    <b><br />
    The city has scheduled the most disruptive work--the replacement of the roadway--for late August or early September.</b><br />
    <br />
    It's another story, though, for the sidewalks. <b>The spaces between the curbs and the building fronts -- sidewalks, planters, light standards -- will be done first on one side of the street and then the other. Then the street will be done.</b><br />
    <br />
    &quot;We keep the roadway in place as long as reasonably possible to keep the dust down,&quot; Saunderson said.<br />
    <br />
    The project will cost $8.8 million, including a $3.2 million from the provincial government. &quot;We are removing the curb so it will be a low-profile curb so it will appear to be one level surface for the most part,&quot; Saunderson said.<br />
    <br />
    The redesign allows for flexible parking -- more spots in the winter, but fewer in the summer when the sidewalks have more people.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;It's an exciting design, to say the least, and it will be quite a noticeable change,&quot; Saunderson said. &quot;It's long overdue.&quot;<br />
    <br />
    A project open house is to be held at city hall on March 19, from 6 to 8 p.m.<br />

    KITCHENER - Out with the concrete and in with the elms, oaks and maples.<br />
    <br />
    This April will usher in a season-long construction project on King Street, part of a $7.6-million makeover turning the downtown into a greener, more pedestrian-friendly place.<br />
    <br />
    By next year, you might not recognize it -- picture over a 100 new trees of six different species, grasses to filter storm water, and wider, &quot;flexible&quot; sidewalks that can be altered for patios and parking spaces.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;When we're done, there won't be anything like it in the region or the province,&quot; boasts Eric Saunderson, the city's project manager.<br />
    <br />
    Workers will begin tearing up the old sidewalk April 6 on the south side of King Street, starting at Gaukel Street and moving west toward Benton Street. At Benton, the work will switch to the north side of the street, and construction will work its way back to City Hall, finishing up in September.<br />
    <br />
    Work further east on King Street, up to Francis Street, is to be done in 2010.<br />
    <br />
    Most people at a public information session last night seemed to like the city's plans.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;Downtown needs a major facelift,&quot; said Bob Clements, who lives in the city's west end.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;We don't shop downtown nearly as much as we used to 20 years ago . . . They need to give people a reason to come back.&quot;<br />

    KITCHENER - The corner of King and Benton streets will be transformed in the coming months into an open, inviting public space as part of the city's $7.6 million makeover of the core's main street.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;It's definitely a big change from what we've had in the past,&quot; Cory Bluhm, an urban planner working in the city's economic development department, said.<br />
    <br />
    Speakers Corner at Benton and King streets has already been cleared of trees, benches and gardens.<br />
    <br />
    In the coming months new benches, trees, gardens, decorative lighting and granite clad walls will be constructed. The new plaza will feature a sculpture by local artist Allan Mackay.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;By September everything should be put back in order,&quot; Bluhm said.<br />
    <br />
    The old corner was small and only a small number of people could sit on the benches there.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;Our hope is by opening it up it is a lot more inviting to a lot more people,&quot; Bluhm said.<br />
    <br />
    &quot;By moving toward more of a wide open, hard surface hopefully that allows groups like Oktoberfest to use it for a lot more public events and special events,&quot; Bluhm<br />
    <br />
    The work at Speakers' Corner is expected to cost about $450,000.<br />
    <br />
    While work is underway at Speakers' Corner, construction started near King and Gaukel streets.<br />
    <br />
    During the coming months workers will proceed along King Street's south side heading toward Speakers' Corner.<br />
    <br />
    Once there, construction switches to the north side of the street and heads back toward Gaukel.<br />
    <br />
    Wider sidewalks, more planters holding about 100 new trees and decorative lighting will be added.<br />
    <br />
    The whole idea is to make that stretch of King Street pedestrian friendly--an area that can easily be closed to vehicles during festivals.<br />

    August 12, 2009<br />
    By Brent Davis, Record staff<br />
    <br />
    KITCHENER — It’s been a difficult summer for downtown businesses, as work continues on one of the most dramatic facelifts in King Street’s history.<br />
    <br />
    The finished product is getting positive reviews in the blocks where work is nearly done. But there’s still about seven weeks to go before the shovels fall silent for the year.<br />
    <br />
    Throughout this first phase of the reconstruction project — which has seen the street narrowed and sidewalks widened to create a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere — maintaining access to businesses has been a priority.<br />
    <br />
    However, with entire chunks of King Street closed to traffic for weeks at a time since the spring, and with another stretch near City Hall temporarily relegated to one-way flow, it’s been tough on many storekeepers.<br />
    <br />
    “We all felt the pinch of slow sales for the two months of construction,” said Dawn Tran, co-owner of the Matter of Taste coffee shop. <b>“Now that it’s open, things are starting to pick up.”</b><br />
    <br />
    <b>Tran said the pain was worth enduring, when she looks at the new streetscape’s planters, modern lights and sidewalks.</b><br />
    <br />
    <b>“Hopefully with this new streetscape, in most people’s eyes the downtown doesn’t seem to be as much of a scary place as it used to be.”</b><br />
    <br />
    At Petsche’s Shoes, signs advertise a blowout sale as the store tries to move unsold inventory and regain some badly-need cash flow.<br />
    <br />
    <b>“The end result looks like it’s going to be beautiful,” manager Anita Petsche Good said. “But we personally have felt that the staging and delays in some of the construction work have definitely been difficult for us.</b><br />
    <br />
    “We’re looking for a full return of vitality down here.”<br />
    <br />
    <b>Work on the first three-block phase is two weeks behind schedule, thanks in part to rainy days and unforeseen complications, project manager Eric Saunderson said. Completion of the first phase is now expected by the end of September.<br />
    </b><br />
    <b>The city is pleased with the contractor’s progress, especially in recent weeks. Saunderson said the $8.8 million project remains on budget.<br />
    </b><br />
    <b>By the end of September, crews should add a base coat of asphalt that will allow for parking on the new brick boulevards when road posts are removed.<br />
    <br />
    A surface layer of asphalt and decorative crosswalks will be added later, likely next year. Next spring, work begins on three blocks on the other side of City Hall.<br />
    </b><br />
    <b>Although specifics on a parking and patio plan still have to be worked out, Saunderson said the new King Street will offer up to twelve additional parking spots when work is complete on the entire six-block stretch.<br />
    </b><br />
    Wider boulevards and movable road posts were designed to allow for a flexible parking configuration.<br />
    <br />
    Originally, the plan this year was to complete one side of King Street at a time. But with input from the Downtown Kitchener business association, the decision was made to complete an entire block at a time.<br />
    <br />
    “There was a lot of interest from the local business community to take this block approach … so they wouldn’t be inconvenienced twice,” Saunderson said.<br />
    <br />
    Restaurateur Peter Martin is critical of what he calls “project mismanagement” in altering the format after work was underway, and not doing a good job communicating the change.<br />
    <br />
    He’s concerned about scheduling that allowed the King Street work to proceed in conjunction with road work on Lancaster and Queen streets, and about the loss of parking spaces at Charles and Benton streets as a parking garage is built.<br />
    <br />
    “There’s a multitude of issues that different levels of government have to deal with, and they’re not all on the same page,” Martin said, inside his 20 King Restaurant.<br />
    <br />
    But he acknowledged the street needs an overhaul, saying the cobblestone sidewalks went in shortly after he opened about two decades ago.<br />
    <br />
    “We’re hearing businesses are down 50 to 70 per cent,” Martin said. “We’re trying to be optimistic about the long-term outcome.”<br />
    <br />
    <b>He said it will be key for the city to attract events to the core that draw crowds and make the most of the new layout.<br />
    </b><br />
    Just down King, as backhoes tear up the street in front of her clothing store, Erin Young remains upbeat.<br />
    <br />
    “I think it’s going to be great when it’s done,” said Young, co-owner of Inception. “Being in the third block, we’re able to see how the first block is looking.”<br />
    <br />
    This is the business’s first brush with construction, but Young said she’s pleased with how crews have maintained access to the store.<br />
    <br />
    “I think we expected it to be what it is,” she said. “We weren’t expecting it to be pretty.”<br />
    <br />
    Saunderson said lessons learned during the first phase of the reconstruction will serve them well next year.<br />
    <br />
    “It’s a very complicated project,” he said. “We understand there are a lot of business needs. We try to go above and beyond to do our best.”<br />

    City hall lighting project</font></b><br />
    <br />
    The city has been awarded $667,000 in federal and provincial infrastructure funding to enhance lighting around the perimeter of Kitchener City Hall (Young, King, College and Duke streets). The city has also contributed $333,000 in funding, which means the total amount allocated for this project is $1 million.<br />
    City Hall<br />
    <br />
    <b>Latest news</b><br />
    <br />
    The lighting consultant for this project has been given approval to order parts for the walkway lighting. L.E.D. light fixtures have been selected for the front aluminum rail and granite benches, as well as the walkway lights.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Project background</b><br />
    <br />
    The lighting upgrades will enhance the look of Civic Square; address some of the perceived safety issues; and highlight and showcase city hall as one of the main architectural features of the city.<br />
    <br />
    Environmentally friendly aspects of the project include the replacement of old lighting technology with better, energy-efficient technology.

    					<b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">Sleeker Speaker’s Corner still retains memories of old one</font></font></u></b><br />
    <br />
    December 05, 2009<br />
    Melinda Dalton, Record staff<br />
    <br />
    KITCHENER— With sleek granite, polished benches and modern light standards, the newly unveiled Speaker’s Corner bears little resemblance to its previous incarnation.<br />
    <br />
    But looking closer at the square’s centrepiece — a shining, stainless steel cylinder — the memory of the old becomes apparent in the new.<br />
    <br />
    “I think, very simply, we often forget our history,” said the man behind the work, artist Allan Harding MacKay. “It was really a way of relocating the memory.”<br />
    <br />
    The redesigned Speaker’s Corner, located at the intersection of King and Benton streets, was unveiled Friday at a ceremony that formally marked the end of the first phase of the King Street redevelopment.<br />
    <br />
    The project started last spring and is projected to cost just under $10 million when it’s finished.<br />
    <br />
    “The reaction we’ve heard so far have been nothing but positive,” said city planner Cory Bluhm.<br />
    <br />
    “I think what we didn’t sense prior to starting this project is there really is a sense of optimism and a sense that King Street really can be a special place for our community.”<br />
    <br />
    The idea behind the project was to transform the city’s main thoroughfare into a sleek, environmentally conscious, urban centre with more places for pedestrians and little reminder of the hard times that have challenged the core.<br />
    <br />
    The first phase included the section of King stretching from Benton up to city hall. New planters, improved and modern-looking street lights and wider sidewalks are the signatures of the newly reinvented downtown.<br />
    <br />
    The idea behind the Speakers Corner renovation was to open up a more viable space for the community, said Bluhm.<br />
    <br />
    “We wanted to make sure it is conducive to public events,” he said. “We wanted to give it a new civic function and still keep with the notion of what Speaker’s Corner was.”<br />
    <br />
    <b>That notion is summed up in the new focal points of the square — the three part installation that blends the corner’s soapbox heritage with its new, sleek facelift.<br />
    <br />
    The work, titled Relocation and Transformation of Memory, is made up of three separate pieces in the square, including the centre sculpture. The piece features and anamorphic image – one that appears distorted unless viewed from a specific perspective.<br />
    <br />
    When a viewer stands on the tiles at the base of the work and looks into the mirrored piece, they can see a photograph of the old square reflected back from a skewed image printed on the tiles.<br />
    </b><br />
    Physics professor Jim Hunt of Guelph worked with MacKay to develop the anamorphic aspect of the piece.<br />
    <br />
    Two granite-clad walls etched with the phrases, “SPEAK UP SPEAK OUT” and “SPEAKINGPUBLICSPEAKING” also border the square. The total cost for the art was $80,000.<br />
    <br />
    The granite etchings mirror some of MacKay’s other high profile work, including the Veterans Memorial at the provincial legislature and the Pape subway modernization in Toronto.<br />
    <br />
    <b>The same granite used for the pieces at Speaker’s Corner will soon cover the new planters lining the entire stretch of King Street.</b><br />
    <br />
    The piece drew a flock of curious onlookers Friday. Most stared for a few moments before cracking a smile when they discovered the reflection of the ghost of the old Speaker’s Corner.<br />
    <br />
    “It’s so cool,” said Ashley Hamilton, who pulled over to check out what was happening in the square after she saw the crowd gathered. “I think it’s a great idea. It’s really beautiful.”<br />
    <br />
    <b>Work on the next phase of project has already started on the two streets bordering city hall. This spring, crews will start work on the stretch of King Street between Francis and Gaukel streets.</b><br />
    <br />
    <b>The major change on that stretch will be the expansion of the civic square in front of city hall. The curbs will be flattened so the square extends flat across King Street. Traffic will still be able to pass, but the area will be flexible and can easily be closed off for events, Bluhm said.</b><br />
    <br />
    <b>The entire redevelopment project is expected to be complete in 2011.</b><br />
