  ARTIST'S SKETCH  <br />
  Regional councillors have tentatively endorsed this design for a bridge over the Grand River linking Kitchener and Cambridge. The long-span girder bridge would cost about $28 million, including roadwork.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  Plans are back on track to build a new bridge over the Grand River by 2010, linking Kitchener to Cambridge.<br />
  <br />
  Waterloo regional councillors had stalled bridge plans for a year, to consult with Six Nations aboriginals who have claimed the Grand River. Yesterday, they agreed to move forward again, voting to hire a consultant to design the bridge.<br />
  <br />
  Construction would take place in 2009 and 2010. The project, linking Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge, is now expected to cost $28 million, including road extensions.<br />
  <br />
  It will be the first new bridge over the Grand in this region since 1963.<br />
  <br />
  Councillors expect it will help ease traffic congestion in south Kitchener while improving connections between Kitchener, Cambridge and Guelph.<br />
  <br />
  By proceeding with a $28-million budget, councillors have effectively ruled out a showcase bridge featuring a bowstring arch.<br />
  <br />
  The proposed bowstring design, reflecting historic bridges in the region, was on a short list of three designs presented to the public last year. It would have cost an extra $8 million.<br />
  <br />
  Instead, council intends to build a basic, long-span girder bridge, with piers kept out of the river, Regional Chair Ken Seiling said. &quot;In an ideal world, if money was no object, we could go with something more. I think we have to have a reasonable design.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr also favours the more basic design.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I support it because it's a balance of esthetics and cost,&quot; Zehr said.<br />
  <br />
  Coun. Jean Haalboom had pressed for a fancier design but did not object yesterday.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;A decision has been made,&quot; she said.<br />
  <br />
  Councillors said they hope other design elements will be incorporated into the bridge to improve its appearance.<br />
  <br />
  The proposed bridge is moving forward again now that regional officials have consulted with rival aboriginal councils that both claim to speak for the Six Nations people.<br />
  <br />
  One is an elected council. The other is a traditional council.<br />
  <br />
  Chiefs from both councils are involved in negotiations to resolve the aboriginal occupation of contested lands at Caledonia.<br />
  <br />
  Six Nations aboriginals claim they never let go of the bed and banks of the Grand River, after they were granted lands along the river in 1784.<br />
  <br />
  Their claim to the river has not been accepted by senior governments.<br />
  <br />
  However, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments must consult with aboriginals about projects that may affect their claims.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;We're going to move forward (on the bridge) in conjunction with ongoing consultations,&quot; Seiling said.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;It's an ongoing process. That's the best I can describe it.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Six Nations officials could not be reached for comment yesterday.<br />
  <br />
  Regional chief administrator Mike Murray attended a meeting with traditional chiefs in January, held at a longhouse on the reserve south of Brantford.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;As a starting point, it was good,&quot; he said.<br />
  <br />
  Several dozen Six Nations people attended, Murray said.<br />
  <br />
  He said the region was not asked to abandon or stall bridge plans. &quot;They had questions. They had comments,&quot; Murray said.<br />
  <br />
  Officials tried to answer their questions.<br />
  <br />
  Murray said aboriginals raised their claim to ownership of the Grand. They were told this is to be resolved between the Six Nations and the federal and provincial governments.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;Our comment was, 'We wish you well, in the negotiations that you're directly involved with,'&quot; Murray said.<br />
  <br />
  Regional officials had previously discussed the bridge plans with the elected Six Nations government.<br />
  <br />
  <u><b>BRIDGE</b></u><br />
  Last year, The Record invited readers to pick a design for a new bridge over the Grand River. There were 640 responses.<br />
  <ul><li>44 per cent favoured a basic design with a long span that is also favoured by regional councillors. Estimated cost for the bridge alone: $13 million.<br /></li>
  <li>24 per cent favoured a basic design with short spans that puts piers in the river. Estimated cost for the bridge alone: $10 million.<br /></li>
  <li>20 per cent favoured a bowstring design that looks like other historic bridges in the region. Estimated cost for the bridge alone: $21 million.<br /></li>
  <li>12 per cent favoured more elaborate bridge designs, costing from $23 million to $70 million.</li>
  </ul><br />
  <br />

  JEFF OUTHIT -WATERLOO REGION (May 15, 2007) <br />
  <br />
  Regional councillors are expected to approve the design of a new bridge over the Grand River today.<br />
  <br />
  Fans of bowstring bridges say it would be a mistake to confirm the flat, basic design that's proposed. They will plead for a bowstring arch that could cost an extra $8 million, but reflects historic bridges built here in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I'm not against practicality. But what I'm against is buying a plain-Jane car and hanging trinkets on it,&quot; said Glen Woolner, a Kitchener housing consultant and heritage proponent.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;What I want to see is something that serves the purpose, does everything that they want to see it do, but has something that is recognizable at a glance, that sticks in your head.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;And that's what our bowstring bridges do. They are prominent. They are memorable.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Coun. Jean Haalboom of Kitchener favours spending more for a bowstring bridge with showcase appeal.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;We talk about urban design. We're talking about tourism, and spending millions of dollars on tourism,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to pay attention to our streetscapes and the entrances to our city.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Other councillors are unwilling to spend more on a design that's not needed to get people across the river.<br />
  <br />
  The bridge as proposed is affordable and &quot;architecturally pleasing,&quot; regional Chair Ken Seiling said. Plans call for enhancing its basic design with landscaping, lighting and other features.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think the public by and large said that they sort of like the middle of the road approach,&quot; Seiling said.<br />
  <br />
  The bridge, to be completed by 2010, will link Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge. It's estimated to cost at least $28 million, including road work.<br />
  <br />
  Public reaction has favoured a flat, basic bridge. A public meeting last year drew 56 per cent in favour of the proposed design. A bowstring design found 31 per cent support.<br />
  <br />
  A Record survey last year found 44 per cent support for the proposed design and 20 per cent support for a bowstring arch.<br />
  <br />
  This will be the first new bridge over the Grand River in Waterloo Region since 1963. It's part of a plan to help ease traffic congestion.<br />

  Regional councillors have endorsed this design for a new bridge over the Grand River, linking Kitchener, on the left, with Cambridge, on the right.<br />

  The bowstring bridge style, shown here, was rejected as too costly, even though it matches bridges built locally in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />
  <br />
  The bowstring bridge, popular 70 years ago, is officially history.<br />
  <br />
  Regional councillors have decided the next new bridge over the Grand River will be a flat span, linking Kitchener to Cambridge.<br />
  <br />
  Yesterday, they voted 14-1 against spending an extra $7 million for a design that reflects three bridges built in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;Seven million (dollars) is a lot of money,&quot; said Coun. Jane Mitchell of Waterloo.<br />
  <br />
  The confirmed design is a long-span girder without piers in the river.<br />
  <br />
  It's to be completed by 2010, linking Fairway Road in Kitchener with Kossuth Road in Cambridge.<br />
  <br />
  This will be the first new bridge to span the Grand River in this region since 1963. Its design has been the subject of public and political debate.<br />
  <br />
  The rejected bowstring design earned 31 per cent public support in a regional survey. It would have cost as much as $20 million.<br />
  <br />
  The approved long-span design earned 56 per cent support in a regional survey. It will cost as much as $12 million.<br />
  <br />
  Councillors hope it can be built to look better than it does on paper.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;It is a glorified road,&quot; said Coun. Sean Strickland of Waterloo. &quot;This bridge as proposed makes no signature, makes no statement whatsoever.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Architects have been directed to suggest ways to dress it up and make it more memorable. This may involve landscaping, lighting, textured concrete or other elements.<br />
  <br />
  Strickland suggested adding a bowstring arch as a cheaper decorative feature, rather than as a costly structural element.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think it's important that we don't underestimate the importance a bridge can have on the psyche of a community,&quot; he said, citing the Brooklyn Bridge in New York and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.<br />
  <br />
  Staff warned that a decorative arch might not be feasible because its weight may require making it part of the bridge structure.<br />
  <br />
  Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig hopes the approved bridge can be given a &quot;21st century&quot; look. He sees no point in echoing bowstring bridges.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think we make our own history,&quot; Craig said. &quot;I think the look has to be a statement of where we are, not what we were.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Region Chair Ken Seiling agrees. Bowstring bridges were the modern bridges of the 1920s, he said. &quot;We shouldn't be afraid to build a modern bridge today.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Coun. Jean Haalboom of Kitchener was the lone dissenter in favour of a bowstring bridge.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;Bridges can form our identity, give us a sense of place,&quot; she said. &quot;They are the symbols that act as branding.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Haalboom fears the approved bridge may be dressed up with little more than checkerboard pillars, a regional crest &quot;and that's all we can afford.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Len Carter, a former municipal candidate, urged councillors to endorse a bowstring design.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;A plain-Jane, nondescript bridge will barely register,&quot; he said.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;If we don't make it memorable, it's going to be forgettable.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  It's estimated the bridge project will cost $28 million, including roadwork. Costs may rise by $6 million if councillors decide to build the bridge four lanes wide from the start.

  					<b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">Project price tag balloons to $55M</font></font></u></b><br />
  <b>Region to discuss Grand River bridge</b><br />
  January 29, 2008 <br />
  JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br />
  <br />
  <img src="/web/20100214043841im_/http://i196.photobucket.com/albums/aa262/AndrewEH/2008%20Singles/2008Jan29-A01.jpg" border="0" alt="" /><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  The proposed cost of a new bridge over the Grand River has more than doubled in two years to $55 million.<br />
  <br />
  Soaring construction costs are largely to blame. Steel, concrete and asphalt prices have all been rising quickly.<br />
  <br />
  The new tally includes $11 million to make the bridge wider, prettier and friendlier for cyclists and pedestrians.<br />
  <br />
  The long-planned bridge will link Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge. Construction could start next year.<br />
  <br />
  Regional councillors will be asked today to approve the rising costs.<br />
  <br />
  Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig wants some design features dropped to save money.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think there should be some features, but they have to be reasonable,&quot; Craig said.<br />
  <br />
  Some other councillors support all the design features, which were just unveiled.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;Crossing the Grand River with a new bridge is a big thing,&quot; Coun. Sean Strickland of Waterloo said.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;We have a choice to make. Do we make it something that's going to have a lasting impression for 100 years or not? It's going to be a really nice bridge, and I think we deserve that.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Councillors agree the bridge needs to be built soon, despite the rising price tag, to help ease traffic congestion in south Kitchener.<br />
  <br />
  It will be the first new crossing of the Grand in this area since 1963.<br />
  <br />
  In 2006, the bridge and road, at two lanes wide, were estimated to cost $23 million. It's now proposed to build four lanes from the start to meet the traffic demand expected by 2021.<br />
  <br />
  Widening ahead of the need will cost an additional $8 million.<br />
  <br />
  Planners say this is cheaper for taxpayers than widening the bridge soon after its completion.<br />
  <br />
  Some residents have asked council to build more than a plain bridge. The proposed response, at an additional cost of $3 million, is to:<ul><li>Sculpt the piers, which would be kept to the riverbanks.</li>
  <li>Add entrance portals at each end.</li>
  <li>Install open railings and special lighting for pedestrians.</li>
  <li>Include lookout areas over the Grand, with stairs to a riverside trail on the Kitchener side.</li>
  <li>Include an on-road cycling lane, an off-road cycling lane for cyclists who fear mixing with traffic, and a separate pedestrian sidewalk.</li>
  </ul><br />
  &quot;We talked about making this bridge a signature bridge,&quot; Coun. Tom Galloway of Kitchener said.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;Some of the scenic lookouts I think are going to be a real attraction. It will attract more walking and more bicycling.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  Planners have ruled out topping the bridge with arches to emulate historic bowstring bridges. False arches, with no structural purpose, would cost between $4 million and $14 million.<br />
  <br />
  Building the bridge and road will take at least two years.<br />
  <br />
  Planners warn construction might not start until 2010, pending the resolution of a dispute over property needed to extend Fairway Road.<br />
  <br />
  The new bridge has already been delayed a year for consultations with Six Nations leaders. The aboriginal nation, near Brantford, claims to own the bed and banks of the Grand.<br />
  <br />

  <b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">Council delays bridge vote</font></font></u></b><br />
  January 30, 2008 <br />
  JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br />
  <br />
  The next bridge over the Grand River finally has a road name but still lacks an approved design.<br />
  <br />
  Regional councillors delayed approving the $55-million project yesterday, pending more details on soaring costs and design extras. But they voted 10-5 to make it part of Fairway Road.<br />
  <br />
  In delaying approval, which could come next month, councillors made it clear they still intend to build the bridge to help ease traffic congestion in south Kitchener. They just want to know more about why estimated costs have more than doubled, in just two years.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;What we're experiencing today is a little bit of sticker-price shock,&quot; said Coun. Sean Strickland of Waterloo.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I'm the last person that doesn't want to see this go ahead,&quot; said Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, who asked that approval be delayed.<br />
  <br />
  The bridge and road, at two lanes wide, were expected to cost $23 million in 2006. Planners expect to provide a better explanation of rising costs soon. Factors include rising construction prices, design features and expansion to four lanes.<br />
  <br />
  Several councillors questioned the need for design extras costing up to $3 million. These include twin bicycle lanes (on-road and off-road) on each side of the bridge, pedestrian lookouts above both riverbanks and sculpted piers.<br />
  <br />
  Councillors were told $500,000 could be saved by removing on-road bicycling lanes. This would still leave off-road lanes for cyclists and a pedestrian sidewalk.<br />
  <br />
  Some councillors said they can support the bridge with all its proposed features because they will help attract hikers and cyclists to the river.<br />
  <br />
  The vote to name the road over the bridge was testy. Three Cambridge councillors asked that Kossuth Road be extended to the bridge on the Cambridge side, while Fairway would be extended to the bridge on the Kitchener side.<br />
  <br />
  However, most councillors said changing the road name at the bridge would puzzle drivers. &quot;Let's do something right for the travelling public, for a change,&quot; said Coun. Jim Wideman of Kitchener.<br />
  <br />
  Instead, Fairway Road will be extended across the bridge to the intersection with Fountain Street in Cambridge. That's where Fairway will end and Kossuth will begin.<br />
  <br />
  The decision disappointed Greg Michalenko, a university professor who advocated extending Kossuth Road toward Kitchener. The road is named after a legendary 19th-century Hungarian patriot. Michalenko sees it as a livelier name than meaningless Fairway. &quot;Planners are so cautious, and sort of dull about this. They should show more spark.&quot;<br />
  <br />

  <b><u><font size="4"><font color="blue">Bridge over Grand is worth the money</font></font></u></b><br />
  January 30, 2008 <br />
  THE RECORD<br />
  <br />
  Driving the main roads of Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo isn't as easy as it once was, and it's only going to become harder in the years ahead. There is a simple reason for this: growth. With Waterloo Region becoming a booming community during the past few decades, there are more vehicles on the roads than ever, which means drivers may become more frustrated than ever.<br />
  <br />
  One addition to Waterloo Region's road system that would help would be another bridge across the Grand River. The region hasn't built a bridge across the Grand since 1963.<br />
  <br />
  Recently, a bridge that would link Fairway Road in Kitchener with Kossuth Road in Cambridge has existed in the minds of regional transportation planners. The region has been gradually moving closer to a decision on the structure. The latest estimate is that the bridge will cost $55 million, which is far higher than the estimate made in 2006 that the bridge would cost $23 million.<br />
  <br />
  There are, however, good reasons for the extra cost. First, construction costs have risen. This should not be surprising in a booming market. Secondly, the latest estimate includes the construction of four lanes, compared to only two in the original plan. The additional two lanes will cost an extra $8 million. The region may not need four lanes for the present amount of traffic, but planners expect the traffic flow will need four lanes by 2021.<br />
  <br />
  That year isn't that far away, and it will be even closer by the time the bridge, in any form, is actually built. Constructing only two lanes now, therefore, would be false economy. The cost to the region in the future of constructing an extra two lanes would be greater than the cost of doing the entire project now.<br />
  <br />
  The harder question relates to what might be called the esthetic additions to the bridge. Planners have suggested options such as lookouts on both sides of the bridge and pedestrian level lighting.<br />
  <br />
  The esthetic issue is harder to deal with because it is subjective. A person who appreciates attractive structures would probably think the extra money is worth spending; a person who has only utilitarian values would disagree.<br />
  <br />
  What can be said is that this bridge is being built for the long run. From the long-term perspective, spending a little extra money now is both appropriate and wise. After all, it isn't every day -- or even decade -- that this region puts a bridge across the Grand.

  <b>Despite rising costs, regional chair says cutbacks 'wrong approach'</b><br />
  February 06, 2008 <br />
  JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br />
  <br />
  Regional council could slash more than $13 million in soaring costs by going back to basics with a new bridge and road over the Grand River.<br />
  <br />
  Savings could come from narrowing the project to two lanes, abandoning pretty design features and forgoing sidewalk and cycling features, according to estimates in a new report.<br />
  <br />
  But slashing costs would be the wrong approach, regional Chair Ken Seiling says.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;This is probably the most highly visible and important piece of infrastructure we have done for awhile,&quot; Seiling said.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;It's one that people will look at, and if we don't do it right, I think there will be a lot of finger-pointing.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I personally don't see us pulling back on it.&quot;<br />
  <br />
  The road and bridge, almost two kilometres in total, will link Fairway Road in south Kitchener to Kossuth Road in north Cambridge. This is meant to help ease traffic congestion in south Kitchener.<br />
  <br />
  Construction could begin next year and conclude in 2010.<br />
  <br />
  Last week, councillors were startled to learn that estimated costs have doubled to $55 million next year, from $28 million last year. Costs are split between the road and the bridge.<br />
  <br />
  Council asked for more spending details before considering costs again at a meeting tonight.<br />
  <br />
  Those new details reveal that inflation, property costs and extra lanes helped double costs. According to road planners:<ul><li>$21 million has been added to reflect construction inflation approaching 12 per cent a year, to include rising property and contingency costs and to build the bridge four lanes wide.</li>
  <li>Another $7 million has been added to add cycling paths and sidewalks, to make the bridge more attractive and to keep piers on the banks, out of the river.</li>
  </ul><br />
  A planning report says that because four lanes will be needed by 2021, it makes financial sense to build the bridge wide, rather than widen it after its completion.<br />
  <br />
  Pretty design features include sculpted piers, lookouts on the Cambridge side, a gateway portal in Kitchener, pedestrian lookouts on the bridge and an open exterior railing.<br />
  <br />
  Almost $1 million has already been cut by narrowing the required centre median. Almost $1 million more could be saved by narrowing, but not eliminating, cycling paths.<br />
  <br />
  The current budget excludes $1 million that could be spent by Cambridge and Kitchener councils on landscaping and streetscaping features.<br />
  <br />
  These include decorative pedestrian lighting, connections to the Walter Bean trail that would run beneath the bridge and poles and banners to decorate the median.<br />

  FRANCES BARRICK - RECORD STAFF - KITCHENER<br />
  <br />
  Despite the big ticket price, Waterloo regional council decided yesterday not to build a bare-bones bridge over the Grand River.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;We either want an enhanced bridge or not,&quot; said Coun. Sean Strickland of Waterloo.<br />
  <br />
  In a recorded 13-to-1 vote, council approved the bridge's design with one minor variation. It will be 60 centimetres narrower for a $500,000 savings, bringing the estimated cost to $54.5 million.<br />
  <br />
  Regional Chair Ken Seiling said the narrower design will not compromise any future plans to have a light-rail transit line across the bridge. It should also permit bicycle paths and sidewalks.<br />
  <br />
  The vote came after much debate about ways to reduce the cost of the project which had nearly doubled in two years.<br />
  <br />
  Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr led the charge by suggesting five design changes for a total savings of $3.2 million. Some of his suggestions included removing the lookouts, a second sidewalk and a bicycle path and redesigning the bridge's piers.<br />
  <br />
  In the end, council only agreed to narrowing the bridge.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think this is nickel and diming,&quot; Coun. Jane Mitchell of Waterloo said of Zehr's suggestions.<br />
  <br />
  Coun. Jim Wideman of Kitchener said it is &quot;fundamentally wrong&quot; to have two bicycle paths to separate the expert cyclists from the recreational ones.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;We don't need two bicycle paths just because experts cannot come down to riding with recreational riders,&quot; Wideman said.<br />
  <br />
  The road and bridge, almost two kilometres in total, will link Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in north Cambridge. It will be the first new crossing of the Grand River in this area since 1963 and its goal is to help ease traffic congestion.<br />
  <br />
  Construction could begin next year and conclude in 2010.<br />
  <br />
  Last week, councillors were startled to learn that estimated costs have nearly doubled to $55 million in 2009, from $28 million last year.<br />
  <br />
  Councillors asked for more information and a staff report showed that a lot of the increase is due to expanding to four lanes from two, inflation, and contingency costs including property acquisition.<br />
  <br />
  Coun. Jean Haalboom of Kitchener voted against the bridge, saying it is the wrong time to build it because of escalating construction costs. She also opposed it because the bridge's design doesn't include a symbol of the region.<br />
  <br />
  Both Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig and Coun. Jake Smola of Kitchener said the bridge's cost estimate of $54.5 million should be a firm number, and if tenders come in higher, council should revisit the whole issue.
