Phil Liggett, cycling journalist and longtime commentator of the Tour de France, will join a pack of 40 cyclists led by seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong through the hills of Waterloo Region. The event is the Ride With Lance, an eastern Canadian version of the annual western Canadian event that raises money for Alberta cancer facilities. For this event, each rider has to raise $25,000 to participate, for a total of $1 million, to be split between Grand River Hospital\'s Regional Cancer Centre and the Odette Cancer Centre at Toronto\'s Sunnybrook Hospital.

Thirty-seven people, including 11 local riders, were registered by Monday. Jim Balsillie, Research In Motion\'s co-chief executive officer, is one of the top five fundraisers, with about $35,000 in pledges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalsillie helped organize the event to benefit the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre and the Odette Cancer Centre at Sunnybrook hospital in Toronto. The fundraiser was started by the Toronto hospital, and Grand River joined when Balsillie got on board and helped recruit Armstrong, said Nancy Hewat, executive director of the Grand River Hospital Foundation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalsillie cycled with Armstrong, a seven-time Tour de France winner and cancer survivor, at a Lake Louise cancer fundraiser last June.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;He\'s the catalyst to getting us involved,&quot; Hewat said.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt hasn\'t been decided how the money will be split between the cancer centres, she said. Local donors can direct their money to the Kitchener hospital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Friday night, Armstrong will speak to the riders briefly at a reception in Toronto. Each rider gets a chance to pedal side-by-side with Armstrong. The top five fundraisers get to sit with Armstrong at the dinner Saturday night. In the running for a spot at Armstrong\'s table is Ian Cook, president of Waterloo-based Cook Homes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;It\'s one thing to be able to ride with Lance.

Morgan will get to ride in the volunteer van for the Ride with Lance Armstrong after he raised thousands for cancer facilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA privileged few will ride beside Lance Armstrong today on Waterloo Region\'s country roads.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMorgan MacPhee is one of them, even though he\'s too young and he didn\'t raise quite enough money to Ride with Lance. Still, the 13-year-old Elmira boy will have an insider\'s view of the fundraiser. And he\'ll be wearing his official Ride with Lance cycling jersey and shorts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrganizers invited Morgan to ride in the volunteer van accompanying the cyclists on their top-secret trek. He also attended the kickoff reception in Toronto last night with his mother Jacinta Faries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt\'s a thank you for his extraordinary effort in raising money for cancer facilities in Kitchener and Toronto. Armstrong and a group of elite fundraisers will leave a North Dumfries location this morning and follow a 100-kilometre route.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMorgan really wanted to be one of the 50 riders, each required to raise a minimum of $25,000, who get the chance to put the pedal to the metal alongside the seven-time Tour de France winner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis mother didn\'t think it was an attainable goal, but Morgan was undaunted.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I told him that\'s a lot,&quot; said Faries. &quot;You don\'t have the connections to raise that kind of money.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe connections Morgan did have included staff and students at Park Manor Senior Public School, and the local McDonald\'s and Home Hardware. They helped him rake in almost $10,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen he found out riders need to be at least 21, a fact left off the application form.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I\'m disappointed that I didn\'t reach my goal, but I\'m excited I get to meet him. I want him to autograph my jersey,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;I think it\'s good that he had one of the worst kinds of cancer, and he recovered, and won the Tour de France.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis interest in the ride was inspired by Armstrong\'s biography, and by his grandparents. Morgan\'s grandmother has survived three bouts of cancer, and his grandfather is an avid long-distance cyclist and former racer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMorgan hopes he\'ll get another crack at raising money to ride with Lance someday, and has no doubt he\'ll be able to keep up. He regularly cycles over 30 kilometres on a $1,400 bike he bought himself with money he saved from working.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ride is expected to raise over $1 million for two cancer centres, including the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">Cyclists ride with Lance for cancer</font></font></u></b><br />\r\nJune 14, 2008 <br />\r\nCharlotte Prong Parkhill<br />\r\nRecord staff<br />\r\n<a href="/web/20100203145002/http://news.therecord.com/article/367210" target="_blank">/web/20100203145002/http://news.therecord.com/article/367210</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src="/web/20100203145002/http://media.therecord.com/images/0f/9e/e52dcbbd43f29e5b78b926b91252.jpeg" border="0" alt="" /><br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor in depth, behind-the-scenes coverage of this event, check out Bill Bean\'s blog on bicycles: <a href="/web/20100203145002/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/" target="_blank">Take the Lane </a> <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWATERLOO REGION -' + '- Local cancer survivor Deb Gemmell is wearing the coveted yellow jersey as she cycles Waterloo Region’s country roads with Lance Armstrong today. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nForty cyclists each raised over $25,000 for the privilege of riding with the seven-time Tour de France winner on a 117 kilometre route today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJim Balsillie teamed up with Sunnybrook Hospital to bring cancer survivor Armstrong to the region.

The secret route, which wound through North Dumfries\' country roads, took just shy of four hours to complete under beaming sunshine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmstrong, joined at an earlier dinner by actor girlfriend Kate Hudson, lent his star power to an event that sparked a fundraising race for the Grand River Regional Cancer Centre and the Odette Cancer Centre at Toronto\'s Sunnybrook hospital.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHis name not only attracted money, it drew quite a crowd, too. Dozens lined the road at the ride\'s starting point outside the Woerner House estate on Roseville Road, cheering wildly as the seven-time Tour de France winner bolted out of the gated compound and hit the road with his grinning entourage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne fan arrived wearing a replica jersey of the U.S. Postal Service racing uniform that Armstrong once wore. The crowd peered down the estate\'s leafy drive, hoping to catch a glimpse of Armstrong at the pre-ride brunch.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmong those waiting at the gate was a very pregnant Maria Pegg, whose husband Shane, a sales manager and son of two cancer survivors, was riding in the group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;If I go into labour, he\'ll have to go up and ask Lance to pick up the pace, and maybe swing by the hospital,&quot; joked Pegg.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmstrong stuck with his pack for most of the route, rotating front-runners so everyone could have their photo taken with him. He signed the photos at the end of the ride, which wound back to the country estate on Roseville Road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the ride, after a few hours of keeping pace with the group of weekend warriors, Armstrong apparently decided to kick into a higher gear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Lance went by me so fast at one point, I thought he was one of the motorcycle cops,&quot; said Tom Wideman, a 47-year-old Kitchener restaurateur.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMorgan MacPhee, the 13-year-old Elmira boy who raised more than $10,000, marvelled that he saw Armstrong passing riders going uphill without using his hands -' + '- while text-messaging on his cellphone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWideman said he and RIM co-chief executive Jim Balsillie -' + '- a key factor in Armstrong\'s agreeing to do the event -' + '- took 20 minutes to catch up to the group after stopping to fix a broken chain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalsillie had cycled with Armstrong at a Lake Louise cancer fundraiser last June, and used his connection to bring the celebrity here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnly a week ago, 54-year-old rider Deb Gemmell didn\'t think she was going to get to be a part of the ride. The cycling enthusiast, diagnosed with breast cancer 18 months ago, desperately wanted to participate. She couldn\'t come up with the required $25,000.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, the Waterloo office of Canaccord Capital surprised her with the news they had come up with the money and registered her for the event.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGemmell was honoured with the ride\'s coveted yellow jersey, traditionally given to the top fundraiser. It was presented to her by Armstrong and Perry Dellelce, who was the actual top fundraiser and co-chair of the event.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGemmell is nearing the end of an exhausting schedule of surgery, radiation treatment and chemotherapy. Her treatment ends in September.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Then we\'ll be back to normal,&quot; said her husband Jonathan Pearce.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe ride was &quot;a dream come true for her,&quot; he added. &quot;Lance Armstrong has always been an inspiration. Your attitude is the most important factor, and she\'s really positive.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the youngest riders was Mildmay\'s Isaac Wilkinson, 18. His mother Jackie was a patient at Grand River before she died of leukemia two months ago at age 48.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter her death, her son read about the Armstrong fundraiser. The teen bought a road bike and collected almost $30,000 around his small town, including money from a seven-year-old who asked for donations to Wilkinson\'s efforts in lieu of birthday presents.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b><u><font size="4"><font color="Blue">Balsillie gets to share the joy during ride</font></font></u></b><br />\r\nJune 16, 2008 <br />\r\nCharlotte Prong Parkhill,RECORD STAFF<br />\r\nWATERLOO REGION<br />\r\n<a href="/web/20100203145002/http://news.therecord.com/article/367714" target="_blank">/web/20100203145002/http://news.therecord.com/article/367714</a><br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoments after completing the Ride With Lance, Jim Balsillie compared the event to a wedding day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExcept this was a marriage of two of his passions -' + '- cycling and philanthropy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I\'m thrilled!&quot; he said, gulping from his water bottle. &quot;It was fun.

Tour de France commentator Phil Liggett and Canadian cyclist Steve Bauer also hit the road, on a course Bauer designed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBalsillie has done plenty of long-distance rides but still found the day challenging. &quot;The pace is tough. You try to stay in the peloton (main group) as much as you can,&quot; he said, wiping sweat out of his eyes. &quot;Waterloo Region has a tremendous number of great riders.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe said conditions couldn\'t have been better. The weather was good, the countryside was beautiful, spectators along the way were nice and the police did a great job of keeping everyone safe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor Balsillie, the day was one of the highlights in his life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Gordie Howe would be the only one that would measure up,&quot; he said. &quot;So for me it\'s massive, a huge thrill.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen he was growing up, he always had big dreams for himself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;And then when you get a little older, the great joy is doing it together and sharing.

Presented by the Share the Road Cycling Coalition, the summit will bring together politicians, planners and advocates with the goal of shaping a provincial cycling policy in the coming years.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA few days later, the Chicopee Ski and Summer Resort will be the setting for the first Ontario Mountain Bike Summit, which will combine hands-on trail building activities with seminars and networking opportunities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We’ve got a growing and burgeoning interest in cycling here,” said Eleanor McMahon, who founded the Share the Road Cycling Coalition after her husband, Greg Stobbart, an OPP sergeant, was killed in an off-duty cycling collision in 2006.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMcMahon feels it’s time Ontario developed a comprehensive bicycle policy, similar to ones already adopted by Quebec and British Columbia.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Ontario Bike Summit, she said, “is a beginning of a conversation with government” on making that happen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo that end, she has invited representatives from Ontario’s Liberal, Conservative, New Democratic and Green parties to participate in a panel discussion.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMcMahon believes the main thing holding back more provinces and municipalities from undertaking cycling master plans is that they don’t know where to begin.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe’s hopeful speakers, including Andy Clarke, Executive Director of the League of American Bicyclists, and Cycling England chair Phillip Darnton, will share their ideas and experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“Most major cities in the world have seized on cycling,” McMahon said, citing its health and environmental advantages. “Why can’t we increase its popularity here?”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCalling Waterloo an ideal host for the summit, McMahon credited the city with its efforts to incorporate cyclists’ needs and concerns into its planning processes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLater that week, the mountain bikers will roll into Kitchener for their own event, which will include group rides and trail work on the Chicopee property.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut there’s also a political slant to this summit, hosted by the International Mountain Bicycling Association, as organizers look to create a provincial mountain biking federation that can address the cyclists’ concerns on a wider scale.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“It can be very locally focused. We can target those issues we’re facing in our areas . . . but every jurisdiction is different,” said Jason Murray, one of the summit’s co-ordinators.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We want to get everybody in the room,” said Murray, who will also be speaking at the Ontario Bike Summit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTopics will include building bike parks and sustainable trails, organizing clubs and working with land managers. The latest film in the New World Disorder series will also have its Canadian premiere during the event.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOrganizers chose Kitchener as an “attractive” location, with bike parks at Chicopee and McLennan Park and strong clubs in Waterloo and Guelph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMurray said the two summits complement each other. “I think it does speak to the surging popularity (of cycling).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n“We’re worried about rising gas prices, environmental impact, sustainability, childhood and adult obesity . . . They all seem to intersect with ‘Go ride a bike.’”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegistration for the Ontario Bike Summit begins at $140 per person, while the mountain bike summit costs $75.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor more information, visit the summit websites at <a href="/web/20100203145002/http://www.sharetheroad.ca" target="_blank">www.sharetheroad.ca</a> and <a href="/web/20100203145002/http://go.imba.com/ontariosummit" target="_blank">/web/20100203145002/http://go.imba.com/ontariosummit</a>.\r\n				</blockquote>\r\n			</div>\r\n\r\n			\r\n\r\n\r\n		</div>\r\n			\r\n\r\n                        	\r\n		        \r\n			\r\n			<blockquote class="signature restore"><div class="signaturecontainer"><a href="showthread.php?t=116" rel="nofollow" title="Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116"><font color="Green"><font size="2"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Kitchener &amp; Nominate our Other Municipalities </b></font></font></a></div></blockquote>\r\n			\r\n\r\n			\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div class="postfoot">\r\n		<div class="textcontrols">\r\n			<span class="postcontrols">\r\n				<img style="display:none" id="progress_290" src="images/misc/progress.gif"  alt="" />\r\n				\r\n\r\n				\r\n				\r\n					<a id="qrwq_290" class="newreply" href="newreply.php?do=newreply&amp;p=290" rel="nofollow" ><img id="quoteimg_290" src="images/buttons/trans_40b.png" alt="Reply With Quote" /> Reply With Quote</a>\r\n					<span class="seperator">&nbsp;</span>\r\n				\r\n				\r\n			</span>\r\n\r\n			<span class="postlinking">\r\n				\r\n					\r\n				\r\n				\r\n\r\n				 \r\n				\r\n\r\n					\r\n\r\n					\r\n					 \r\n\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n					\r\n			</span>\r\n		</div>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<hr />\r\n</li>\r\n  ';
