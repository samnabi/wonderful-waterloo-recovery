Which itself is debatable, since in the long run the development charges and arguably the indirect benefits will nowhere near pay for all the subsidies for maintaining and replacing all of that infrastructure.<br \/>   <br \/>   It's not that a municipality should not invest in anything. But investment in sprawl helps drive demand for more sprawl, destroys farmland, hurts our water supply, clogs up roads all over the city, decreases the quality of our air, decreases the overall health of the population, and increases the dangers to motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists. So there are costs to investing in sprawl, and I think we have a sufficient amount of what the suburbs have to offer that any more is no longer outweighing those costs.<br \/>   <br \/>   There are also opportunity costs of investment in such things as widening Ira Needles Blvd. What else could the Region spend that money on? I bet the cost of widening it could pay for building a Spur Line Trail, an extension of the Iron Horse Trail, and dozens of kilometres of new sidewalks where there currently aren't any. It could pay for a very large bike-sharing system. It could pay for more affordable housing so more people here can contribute to our economy and have an acceptable quality of life.<br \/>   <br \/>   I've had enough of our subsidy for sprawl. How about we instead invest in a better quality of life?","signature":"","date":"01-21-2011 04:01 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"91"},"23403":{"user":{"name":"waterloo_local","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Jul 2010","num_posts":"86"}},"content":"This land was never nor ever intended to be farm land.

The Fieldgate will always be difficult to turn left into.  They should have used a small roundabout there for entrance.  I find it very easy to get in\/out of Boardwalk\/Empire now using the roundabouts, even with heavy traffic.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     I had previously posted about left turns out of Fieldgate being difficult - I stopped twice at the Shoppers there last week,and the right turn out of the plaza is not simple either.<br \/>    <br \/>    Thinking about this, it could be due to the nature of the upstream roundabout.  Unlike a stoplight, a roundabout does not platoon the traffic, leaving gaps for vehicles to make right or left turns.  It produces an almost regularly spaced stream.","signature":"","date":"Yesterday 03:40 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"114"},"26559":{"user":{"name":"Waterlooer","avatar":"\/web\/20110225044735im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=284&amp;dateline=1288713241","title":"Youth Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"568"}},"content":"I went to the Sobeys here and it was very nice, it looks like a nice plaza.","signature":"<i>Visit my Youth Blog:<\/i> <b><a href=\"\/web\/20110225044735\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/youth\" target=\"_blank\">wonderfulwaterloo.com\/youth<\/a><\/b> <i>&amp; email me at:<\/i> <font color=\"royalblue\"><b>youth@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/b><\/font>","date":"Yesterday 04:05 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"115"},"26561":{"user":{"name":"bcwessel","avatar":"\/web\/20110225044735im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=311&amp;dateline=1289256677","title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"May 2010","num_posts":"280"}},"content":"This looks like a nice plaza: <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20110225044735im_\/http:\/\/farm1.static.flickr.com\/210\/495266522_7177685d58.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   Fieldgate is a &quot;commercial site,&quot; which is another way of saying &quot;some warehouses sitting around a parking lot.&quot;  You can shop at both, but only one is a &quot;bargain.&quot;  Let's call a spade a spade.","signature":"<i>&quot;I have always believed that what is originally an abuse does not cease to be one by having become customary.&quot;<\/i>","date":"Yesterday 04:32 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"116"},"26567":{"user":{"name":"Waterlooer","avatar":"\/web\/20110225044735im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=284&amp;dateline=1288713241","title":"Youth Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"568"}},"content":"All I meant was it's very clean and organized (hopefully it will stay that way).","signature":"<i>Visit my Youth Blog:<\/i> <b><a href=\"\/web\/20110225044735\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/youth\" target=\"_blank\">wonderfulwaterloo.com\/youth<\/a><\/b> <i>&amp; email me at:<\/i> <font color=\"royalblue\"><b>youth@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/b><\/font>","date":"Yesterday 04:59 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"117"},"11968":{"user":{"name":"Duke-of-Waterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110225045355im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=24&amp;dateline=1290460886","title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"1000"}},"content":"<b><font color=\"blue\">PERMIT IS FOR SITE SERVICES FOR A COMMERCIAL PLAZA.

I tend to disagree with his statement though: we're just a lot smaller than Toronto, whereas our suburban areas are simply neighbourhoods within the city rather than entirely separate municipalities.  We also are weaker than Toronto, but that doesn't mean we're a completely different kind of entity, as no two cities are going to be exactly the same.  For example if you were to look at employment levels, Toronto has roughly <a href=\"\/web\/20110225045355\/http:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/demographics\/pdf\/survey2009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">508,100<\/a> jobs in it's Downtown and Centres out of a metropolitan employment level of <a href=\"\/web\/20110225045355\/http:\/\/www.statcan.gc.ca\/pub\/71-001-x\/2010005\/t014-eng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">2,919,800<\/a>.  That works out to 17.4%.  In this region, I'd consider our main Downtown and Urban Centre to be from King &amp; University to King &amp; Ottawa.  I'd say there's at least 30,000 jobs in that area, out of our metro employment level of <a href=\"\/web\/20110225045355\/http:\/\/www.statcan.gc.ca\/pub\/71-001-x\/2010005\/t014-eng.htm\" target=\"_blank\">260,500<\/a>.  That works out to an 11.5% share.  Now 11.5 is much weaker than 17.4, but I personally consider it to still be the same game, just one with a rating slightly below average (Waterloo Region) and another that's strongly above average (Toronto).  It's not as though urban Toronto has a 50% employment share, whereas ours is 1 or 2%.  It also helps Toronto significantly that it's the largest city and the financial capital of the country, although if I have my way we'll eventually have a 'Bank of Waterloo' to call home to in our core.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110225045355\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/219-Light-Rail-Transit?p=25288#post25288\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"darkgreen\">cc LRT Letters to <a href=\"mailto:letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com\">letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/a><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"06-19-2010 10:04 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"11"},"8793":{"user":{"name":"Urban_Enthusiast86","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"339"}},"content":"I would echo the sentiment that certain (many) parts of the tri-cities are Milton-esque.

It's easy to lose sight of just how much is going on in the central areas when you look at some of the offensive looking sprawl popping up at the edges of town.

Both have somewhat of a transient commuter demographic living in each and both are definitely in that 1 hour orbit.  But we're also quite a bit larger and more self-sufficient...still suburban, but feels more like a city.  I knew a guy who used to live in Barrie but now lives near downtown Kitchener and that was one of the differences he mentioned.  The core is larger, there's more arts &amp; culture, more of a corporate base, and the city as a whole is much more cosmopolitan in just about every way.  But conversely, Barrie wins on the recreational front, being the gateway to cottage country.  Neither can be grouped right in with Milton.","signature":"","date":"06-22-2010 12:57 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"15"},"8873":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20110225045355im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Conurbation Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5043"}},"content":"Does Barrie have more transit options to Toronto?

Jan d&#8217;Ailly revealed Thursday that he will challenge Mayor Brenda Halloran, who is seeking re-election.<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s an early launch to the 2010 municipal campaign. The election is expected next October and candidates can&#8217;t even register until January.<br \/>   <br \/>   D&#8217;Ailly, 50, was first elected to Waterloo council in 2003 and now represents Ward 6. He runs a waste-energy technology company, and has management experience in business development and strategic planning.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I move projects forward and get things done,&#8221; he said, citing his council and business experience. &#8220;It&#8217;s time to move the city forward.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Incumbent Halloran, 54, is completing her first term and said she has more she wants to do, including working to bring more doctors and a family health team to the city.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I&#8217;m very confident in the job I&#8217;ve done as mayor,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve given this community strong leadership.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   She was not surprised to learn d&#8217;Ailly will challenge her. &#8220;I&#8217;ve known for quite a while he was planning on running.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Residents re-elected d&#8217;Ailly in 2006 after he had a run-in with the law in 2004.<br \/>   <br \/>   He had to comply with the terms of a peace bond, commonly known as a restraining order, in return for the withdrawal of an assault charge laid after he slapped his wife.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I made a mistake,&#8221; D&#8217;Ailly said. He has since divorced and remarried and says he has put the private incident behind him.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><u><font color=\"Blue\"><font size=\"4\">New faces but no major reforms in local elections<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   December 28, 2009 | Jeff Outhit, Record Staff | <a href=\"\/web\/20100927183511\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/649378\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/649378<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   WATERLOO REGION &#8212; You&#8217;ll see an earlier election date and you&#8217;ll see two city councils expand in the municipal campaign that launches Jan. 4.<br \/>   <br \/>   But you won&#8217;t see the major reforms that a pro-reform lobby group was seeking.<br \/>   <br \/>   Highlights of the 2010 municipal election:<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s been moved ahead to Oct. 25, to escape miserable November weather. The term remains four years.<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener is adding four councillors. Cambridge is adding two councillors. The total number of municipal politicians in the region will grow by six to 57.<br \/>   <br \/>   Waterloo residents and some others will be asked by referendum if they want to continue fluoridating drinking water.<br \/>   <br \/>   Pro-reform residents had called on politicians to merge some local councils in 2010, saying this would streamline municipal government. Their effort, launched in 2008, got little traction and politicians chose instead to tinker with the election.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed but we&#8217;re not discouraged,&#8221; said Jim Erb, spokesperson for the group Citizens for Better Government. He said he hopes candidates make reform a municipal election issue.<br \/>   <br \/>   Local mayors applaud the provincial government for advancing the election to the fourth Monday in October. It&#8217;s hoped this change will improve turnout.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;The date will probably make it more convenient for people,&#8221; said Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, who has not decided whether to seek re-election.<br \/>   <br \/>   The new date shortens the long municipal campaign by a few days, sets the election in potentially better weather, and gives local governments more time to prepare for the inauguration of new councils.<br \/>   <br \/>   Cambridge council is expanding to nine members in the election. Kitchener council is expanding to 11. Proponents contend expansions will improve governance and spread the council workload around.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It will allow for a wider diversity of opinion on council, and of course representation,&#8221; said Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig, who is seeking re-election. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very good news for everybody.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;You have a chance of having more representation and more views on a subject, so that&#8217;s a good thing from a democratic standpoint,&#8221; Zehr said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Zehr expects the next Kitchener council will be mostly newcomers, as council opens up four new seats and some incumbents decline to see re-election.<br \/>   <br \/>   Waterloo council is staying at eight members. Regional council is staying at 16, including seven mayors. Four townships are staying at five members each.<br \/>   <br \/>   The municipal campaign formally launches Jan. 4, the first day candidates can register for office. They must register before they can raise money or spend it.<br \/>   <br \/>   Zehr and Craig want local politicians to debate municipal reform during the next council term. Regional Chair Ken Seiling doubts reform will happen until provincial politicians signal their interest in shaping it.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Clearly the province hasn&#8217;t shown an interest in touching municipal structures,&#8221; said Seiling, who has not announced if he will seek re-election.<br \/>   <br \/>   Ontario has made changes to financing rules for the municipal election. The province will also require more accessible voting places.","signature":"","date":"12-29-2009 12:09 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"420":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100927183511im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=da88a7c56c89590fd458169e5d7882f1&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,551","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Candidates gear up for municipal elections<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   January 4, 2010 | Melinda Dalton, Record Staff | <a href=\"\/web\/20100927183511\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/650114\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/650114<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   WATERLOO REGION &#8212; Municipal elections may still be months away, but the race is on already in several communities across Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Monday marked the first official day candidates could register for the October elections in the three cities and the region.<br \/>   <br \/>   First out of the gate in Waterloo was Mayor Brenda Halloran, who registered her bid for a second term.<br \/>   <br \/>   Close behind was Waterloo Ward 6 Coun.

Not that you'd expect more, I mean if you're going to all you can eat, you're there for quantity not quality.  Fish is cut very poorly (some times not at all!), rice not formed properly, only the salmon can be considered anywhere close to &quot;fresh&quot;.  Most other raw ingredients come out half frozen or not trimmed properly.  Consistency is not their strong point either... they seem to throw whatever they feel like into their special rolls.  It's really like McDonald's.. you get these irrational cravings for it, but regret it every time you go.. but once the memory fades you'll be back.<br \/>    <br \/>    Yummiyaki - slightly better preparation, but very busy especially at lunch time.  A bit more expensive than Ye's and less variety.<br \/>    <br \/>    Casa Mia - They seem to put more care into the product, and the few times I've had take-out there I've been pretty happy with it.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mr. Sushi - haven't been there in a long time,  but I used to drop by there for a quick take-out meal.  High turnover so even the pre-packaged boxes were reasonably fresh.  Portions were decent and prices were reasonable as well.<br \/>    <br \/>    Niko Niko - probably my current favourite place, a bit out of the way for me so we don't go there often.  More interesting\/innovative rolls, very nice plating and execution, reasonable prices.<br \/>    <br \/>    Soul Seoul - again it's been awhile, but never had a good experience there service wise, so I'm never going back.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sakura Island - used to go here frequently, but I've only been back once since they've renovated.  I remember the prices being pretty expensive compared to the newer places that have opened up, and it didn't seem worth the premium.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mac Sushi (Conestoga Mall) - acceptable quality at inflated food court prices.  Cheaper after 5pm though as they clear out stuff.  High turnover so fresh at peak times.<br \/>    <br \/>    Taka - years ago used to be the only place we'd go, but back then there wasn't much choice (this was before the sushi really took off in the mainstream).  Had a good Korean menu along with decent Japanese stuff.  I know they've gone through a few sushi chefs so I can't comment on how it is now.  Used to see lots of Japanese workers from Toyota there, so that's probably a good sign.<br \/>    <br \/>    Supermarket sushi - actually this is as low as you can get.  Stale product, dry rice, soggy seaweed, ugh.  Avoid.<br \/>    <br \/>    Overall I guess I can't complain if I can list 10 places in just KW... not bad for a landlocked meat &amp; potatoes town! <img src=\"\/web\/20110227035109im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/wink.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Wink\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/>","signature":"","date":"04-03-2010 03:20 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"10"},"3822":{"user":{"name":"Shawn","avatar":"\/web\/20110227035109im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=6ad14678bf70f73411f4fca1e9200fc3&amp;u=46&amp;dateline=1265315401","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"520"}},"content":"Niko Niko is also my favourite Sushi and rolls restaurant in KW.

Since it's only a block away from Ye's, a comparison is in order.  Ye's is on the bottom of my list for sushi in KW.  The fish is sliced too thinly.  Except for the salmon, the pieces of fish are often semi-frozen, with the taste dulled by the cold.  The proportion of fish to rice in the sushi is wrong, but more profitable for Ye's.  The sauces for many of the dishes from the kitchen is overly sweet and gelatinous.  And then there's the servers, cafeteria runners mostly.  On average, 25% of your orders will end up on someone's table and 25% of the food they bring you are things you didn't order.  Complain for all the good it will do you.  Fine dining, this is not.  Actually, it's not even acceptable for a $23 meal.  But we put up with this either because we think that this is what sushi should be or this place can accommodate our group of 12 from work.<br \/>    <br \/>    Now just one block away, there is a much better choice.  The menu is more interesting, with items that I haven't seen anywhere else in KW.  Service is excellent.  Not only are the servers polite, attentive, and helpful, the manager stops by periodically.  Clearly they are trying hard to win business from the shell-shocked patrons of Ye's.  <br \/>    <br \/>    Unlike Ye's bright and glaring cavern, Sushi 99 has some atmosphere.  The furnishings are new and stylish.  It feels more like a mid-priced restaurant than it does a cafeteria.<br \/>    <br \/>    For KW, this sushi is great.  Yes, I've been to Tojo's in Vancouver and yes, there's no comparison.  However, it is still enjoyable and it is very good compared to our other choices in this area.  Among other items, I had the salmon sashimi.  The fish was cut thickly and served at the right temperature.  What a difference that makes.  The texture was velvety and the taste was wonderful.  The variety of fish was larger than Ye's list.  The red snapper wasn't half frozen as it in Ye's.  I also had the kalbi (3.5 stars out of 5) and the salmon kama (5 stars out of 5).  The salmon skin hand roll used salmon skin broiled just right (4 stars out of 5).<br \/>    <br \/>    There was so much that I wanted to try but didn't have room.  I'll be back for another trip very soon.","signature":"","date":"10-03-2010 09:58 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"15665":{"user":{"name":"Duke-of-Waterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20101017214633im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=24&amp;dateline=1272669526","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo, ON    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 658    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 8","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Thanks for the review UrbanAndUrbane.

Proximity to the ocean is key.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> In today's global economy, proximity to an international airport is more important than proximity to the ocean.  Neither Montreal nor Toronto are seaside cities.  And while Vancouver is by the Pacific Ocean, little of the sushi that is served in that city comes from the waters nearby.<br \/>    <br \/>    The most highly prized bluefin tuna served in sushi restaurants throughout Tokyo start the day flown in through the Narita Airport and sold as entire frozen tunas at 5:00 AM in the Tsukiji fish market to restaurateurs.  They might have been caught one or two days earlier in the North Atlantic.  The excellent book &quot;Sushi Economy&quot; by Sasha Issenberg presents a good picture of the global markets created by our appetite for sushi.<br \/>    <br \/>    So if it isn't local access to the Pacific Ocean that allows high end sushi restaurants to succeed in Vancouver and not Waterloo, what is it?  For one of these restaurants to succeed, there must be enough of a core population of Japanese sushi chefs, similar to the chef at Tojo's.  Most, if not all, of the local sushi restaurants are run by either Chinese or Koreans.  While Korean cuisine shares some items with Japanese cuisine, the same is not true for the Chinese.  <br \/>    <br \/>    Besides talented chefs who really understand sushi, a high end restaurant also needs steady business from those who are willing to pay top dollars for superb food.  This can be sustained in Vancouver with its large Asian population, tourists from throughout the world, and business people with more extravagant entertainment budgets.  I've paid more for my dinner at Tojo's than I have for a table of four at Ye's.  Are there enough people in Waterloo Region who are sufficiently sophisticated that they would pay $80 for a fine meal instead of $20 for all you can eat?<br \/>    <br \/>    The situation in Waterloo Region is improving.  Not that long ago, there were no sushi restaurants at all.  The Tien Hoa was regarded as exotic Asian dining.  As our local work force have now traveled throughout the world in search of global business, they return with enlarged appetites.  Even our Mennonite population can be found in our more &quot;exotic&quot; restaurants.  At some point, there may be a very good sushi restaurant.  But don't expect it to be an AYCE.","signature":"","date":"10-04-2010 12:28 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"30"},"15682":{"user":{"name":"ruud","avatar":null,"title":"Hamlet Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date May 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 8    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"I had lunch at Sushi 99 today for the first time - just like the others it was much, much better then Ye's.","signature":"","date":"10-04-2010 12:57 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"31"},"15683":{"user":{"name":"plam","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 107    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 508","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20101017222853im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>UrbanAndUrbane<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20101017222853\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=15681#post15681\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20101017222853im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">So if it isn't local access to the Pacific Ocean that allows high end sushi restaurants to succeed in Vancouver and not Waterloo, what is it?

This can be sustained in Vancouver with its large Asian population, tourists from throughout the world, and business people with more extravagant entertainment budgets.  I've paid more for my dinner at Tojo's than I have for a table of four at Ye's.

But it has not set a start date for construction.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    It\u2019s important to widen Highway 7\/8 between Fischer-Hallman Road and Courtland Avenue. The overwhelmed highway regularly backs up as commuters head to west Kitchener neighbourhoods.<br \/>    <br \/>    The province announced $150 million in funding last year. Ministry of Transportation spokesperson Bob Nichols now says the construction launch is \u201csubject to change based on funding, design, environmental approvals, property acquisition and construction requirements.\u201d <b>When work begins, it will take three years.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <b>An open house is planned to solicit public input into the highway design. It\u2019s on April 28 from 4 to 8 p.m. at the Concordia Club at 429 Ottawa St. S. in Kitchener.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed expansion includes:<br \/>    <br \/>    Widening from four to six lanes, plus the addition of a median barrier. There would be eight lanes between Courtland and Homer Watson Boulevard. This will ease bottlenecks and improve safety, by keeping out-of-control cars from sliding into oncoming traffic across the grassy median. Planners now intend to widen the road almost two kilometres west of Fischer-Hallman.<br \/>    <br \/>    Remodelled interchanges at Courtland, Homer Watson Boulevard and Fischer-Hallman.<br \/>    <br \/>    Better lighting and some new noise barriers, to better shield adjacent neighbourhoods.<br \/>    <br \/>    All this makes sense. The biggest challenges are the non-standard interchanges, which are generally overwhelmed and rather awkwardly built.<br \/>    <br \/>    Plans for the Fischer-Hallman interchange include the addition of an eastbound on-ramp. This would help ease the traffic mess near the Sunrise shopping centre.<br \/>    <br \/>    At the Homer Watson interchange, local planners have proposed a second on-ramp to the eastbound expressway, at Alpine Road. If approved, it would ease pressure on the eastbound on-ramp at Ottawa Street. It\u2019s overwhelmed, which contributes to headaches at Ottawa and Homer Watson.<br \/>    <br \/>    Greenbrook Drive resident John Innanen has pitched connecting the dead end of Highland Road to the westbound off-ramp, just metres away. This would provide a smoother expressway exit for northbound vehicles. It would likely draw traffic from busy Greenbrook. However, it might increase Highland traffic, while also putting more trucks and cars past Queen Elizabeth Public School, next to the interchange. That\u2019s a trade-off that may not win support.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are no plans to connect the expressway to Westmount Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    The last open house on expressway widening drew 47 people in 2006. A stronger turnout would be helpful as the project inches closer to its launch.<br \/>    <br \/>    Jeff Outhit can be reached at 519-895-5642 or <a href=\"mailto:jouthit@therecord.com\">jouthit@therecord.com<\/a>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     <br \/>    &quot;eight lanes between Courtland and Homer Watson&quot;   Is this really necessary?

I imagine they are keeping them up to Homer Watson to eliminate the current problem of drivers exiting from the 8 having to move over two lanes (one ends and one exits at Courtland) in about 500 meters. Not only does this cause backlogs in traffic, but it is very dangerous and a number of accidents have occured in this area.<br \/>    <br \/>   Additionally, the Courtland and Homer Watson exits are very close together (800m?) so the costs for these extra lanes is not huge (relative to the rest of the project).<br \/>    <br \/>   Also, I would estimate about 1\/3 of the traffic exits the highway at Homer Watson with relatively little traffic exiting at Courtland. I don't think it wouldn't make sense to end a lane at a relatively little-used offramp.<br \/>    <br \/>   Just my two cents having driven that stretch many, many times.","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

The end of the collector lanes is a good example; the highway goes from eight lanes to four when it enters Waterloo. Maybe the Provincial Government views Waterloo as not large enough to warrant highway upgrades. I would wager that the traffic at Lancaster and the 85 is approximetely the same as Courtland and the 85.","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

During the mornings, heading into Waterloo and heading back during the evening. There is definitely more traffic on the kitchener end. The Waterloo bottleneck as much due to the volume as to drivers trying to jump the queue. If drivers wouldn't use the collectors as a quick way to pass and take them all the way to almost the Lancaster overpass only to squeeze in and slam on their brakes it would work quite well and the speed in the core lanes would not be affected. The speed quickly increases right past the Lancaster overpass. And cars coming on from Lancaster do not slow things down much more. On the other end many times the traffic is backed up over highway 8. And traffic coming in from highway 8 helps feed this more. The right lane exiting at Courtland is often used by inconsiderate drivers for queue jumping in the same way as the collectors to the east. Unlike the Lancaster area the speed does not increase much past Courtland. There is a substancial amount of traffic entering the highway at Courtland and many cars exiting at Homer Watson, often the slowest part of the drive home is in the two lane westbound section immediately after the Courtland interchange.  <br \/>   <br \/>   This work defintely needs to be done, but I do agree that the Waterloo end needs upgrades too, I can see it getting much worse once the new highway 7 is built, a freeway to freeway interchange removes the ramp metering effect that the current signal controlled interchanges have on the flow of traffic onto the highway.","signature":"","date":"05-01-2010 09:37 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"32"},"5923":{"user":{"name":"KLM","avatar":null,"title":"Junior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date May 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 29","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"finally! it was about time to put this in place.I live near Sunrise Plaza and Fisher-Hallman exit\/entrance is a mess.That left turn on light is a poker game.<br \/>    <br \/>    I havent look much into detail pics ,would be good solution to make collector between Courtland and Homer-Watson ( something similar with Victoria\/Lancaster exit?)just for sake of proximity.<br \/>    <br \/>    In my opinion yes this needs to be upgraded and what I saw I am happy but they would avoid all those expansions if they made full loop around k-w.

I'd certainly pay $50 and $70 for that service instead of using something like Airways Transit or paying $50\/week to park at YYZ. The main problem for me with AT is that they need 2 hours or more to get people from Waterloo Region to YYZ because (1) they need time to pick up passengers to fill their vans and (2) they some slack in case of traffic problems on the 4-oh-1. Driving myself is only slightly faster, especially if I park at a discount lot.

The iXpress could reduce its travel time by a not insignificant amount with better signal priority. The only reason it doesn't is that traffic engineering here is focused on helping cars move faster. As a result the iXpress has a very low level of priority and only on a small number of corridors.<br \/>   <br \/>   The plan for the 2011 budget is to expand transit signal priority transmitters to more (all?) of the GRT fleet. Personally I'm hoping they increase the level of signal priority and expand it to more intersections. Obviously not emergency vehicle level priority, but higher. It speeds transit vehicles and simultaneously slows private vehicles, a strong transit incentive. It also likely represents an improvement for cyclists, as the green wave timing required for cycling speeds is much closer to the one required for transit than it is to the one for cars.","signature":"Taylor Byrnes","date":"04-10-2010 04:56 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"4400":{"user":{"name":"DKsan","avatar":null,"title":"Junior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Apr 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 26","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Is there a way to find out if streets are &quot;green wave&quot; or not clearly?","signature":"","date":"04-10-2010 07:56 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"4439":{"user":{"name":"mpd618","avatar":null,"title":"Senior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo, ON    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 290","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20100524205025im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>IEFBR14<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20100524205025\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=4360#post4360\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20100524205025im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">Green waves represent a rare win-win-win situation in that they make for a less stressful driving experience, a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists who cross them and reduce fuel consumption, pollution and brake wear.

When it's flashing you know that the traffic light at Lincoln will turn red before you get there. In that situation there's no reason to speed down University (at least as far as Lincoln.) You might as well lay off the gas pedal and coast to the red light. By my observation that signal is effective in slowing traffic down. This sort of signal device is very common on the west coast, especially on Vancouver Island, in enforcing speed limits without the need for cops, photo radar and the like. So yes, it is possible to calm traffic on major roads.","signature":"","date":"04-11-2010 09:18 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"4447":{"user":{"name":"panamaniac","avatar":null,"title":"Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 88","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Is King Street through Preston the kind of synchronized system you have in mind?

The co-op failed (for unrelated reasons) at which point the two owners (Shawn and another guy whose name I forget) became Adventure Guide. Their original Waterloo store was on King, just north of University. (IIRC where Bhimas Warung is now located.)

The City of Cambridge has done just this, subsidizing private business person Paul de Haas to the tune of $4.2 million. And what's more, despite the criticism dumped on it, the city was absolutely right to do so.<br \/>    <br \/>    For 30 years, a property contaminated with coal tar has stood as a vacant eyesore at the gateway to Galt, at Water and Ainslie streets. Plans to build on it collapsed in the mid-1980s because of the high cost of fixing the site's environmental problems. Meanwhile, $400,000 in back taxes owed to the city remain unpaid. Sticking with the status quo is a losing situation for everyone.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mindful of this, city council rightly decided to step in and finally make things happen. It will waive the development charges that would normally be billed to the developer. Moreover, the city will give a hefty subsidy -- a citizens delegation put it at roughly $18,000 a unit -- to each of the 230 condominiums that will be built. The total cost to taxpayers is $4.2 million. And, yes, that looks steep.<br \/>    <br \/>    But look at the returns on the city's investment: It will turn an abandoned industrial site into desirable residential property and help revitalize an urban core.<br \/>    <br \/>    It will get an environmentally clean site because the developer will dig up and remove the coal tar that now contaminates the area. It will get a major project, because the developer will build two, 12-storey towers with 230 units worth $120 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    From these condominiums, the city will get something it's not getting from the property today: tax revenue. And in time, those taxes should more than cover the city's payout to the developer. All this, by the way, satisfy the demands of a new provincial policy that calls for more intense growth in the downtowns of cities like Cambridge. And it's also worth noting that the city has not given this developer special treatment. It's simply acting according to city policies that would assist any developer in similar circumstances trying to reclaim old industrial land.<br \/>    <br \/>    Yes, the city could have done nothing and let the site sit empty for another three decades. Yes, the city could have paid millions to clean up the site on its own and then sell it or use it as a park. But none of those alternatives beat what the city has done. This is one occasion where city council deserves cheers not jeers. It got this one right.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Cleanup rules threaten condos<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <b>Developer asks Cambridge for help getting riverside project going<\/b><br \/>    December 10, 2007 - KEVIN SWAYZE, RECORD STAFF<br \/>    CAMBRIDGE<br \/>    <br \/>    A $120-million luxury condominium project is in \"great jeopardy\" unless city council waives its own rules and allows construction to start before a contaminated part of the downtown property is cleaned up.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterscape developer Paul de Haas is scheduled to appeal to council tonight for help getting the 230-home project back on track.<br \/>    <br \/>    He wants to put a contaminated part of the property under separate legal ownership, which would allow him to go ahead with the condo project on the remaining land.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city has said the land, a former factory site on Water Street at the north junction of Ainslie Street, must be cleaned up before it is severed.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Environment Ministry is also looking at more stringent requirements for cleaning up buried coal tar to ensure it doesn't spread to the Grand River just metres away.<br \/>    <br \/>    But in a letter to council, de Haas suggests the cleanup requirements are standing in the way of his 12-storey condo towers.<br \/>    <br \/>    He says severing the contaminated part of the land would allow him to obtain loans to build the two towers on the north half, while delaying the need to clean up and build on the southern half.<br \/>    <br \/>    The letter says a business partner planning to develop a retirement complex on the south half of the 1.4 hectare property has backed out. De Haas says he's confident a new partner will be found, but not in time to meet city requirements to get construction started quickly on the condo project on the north half of the site.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The severance is vital to the financing and structuring of the Waterscape project,\" he says.<br \/>    <br \/>    He offered the city a $50,000 letter of credit \"as a gesture of a good faith guarantee that we will complete the remediation of the south land within 36 months\" of receiving Environment Ministry approval of a cleanup plan.<br \/>    <br \/>    That's expected shortly, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Although not conforming to the policy, we ask that council accept this as another signal of my company's undivided commitment to this project.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Already, de Haas said, his company has spent $400,000 on consulting fees and testing of the one-time home of the Galt Gas Works, which operated there from 1887 to 1911. Coal tar is a by-product of coal-gas production. It is considered a health risk and causes cancer<br \/>    <br \/>    The gas plant was demolished in the 1920s to make way for a textile mill, which was demolished in the 1980s, in anticipation of a residential building project.<br \/>    <br \/>    De Haas said the rejuvenation of the eyesore property is \"logistically complex and saddled with numerous challenges -- many more than we ever anticipated.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Council considers the request from deHaas tonight in a meeting starting at 6 p.m. in historic city hall.<br \/>    <br \/>    City staff recommend council reject the request to ignore city rules aimed at protecting taxpayers from getting stuck with expensive cleanups.<br \/>    <br \/>    Council has already approved the Waterscape plan, which includes $4.2 million in public money to help clean up the site, deferral of property taxes and move a public sewer line from the middle of the property.<br \/>    <br \/>    Most of the money comes from long-standing city programs to encourage developers to clean up old factory sites in the Galt, Preston and Hespeler cores.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterscape is also exempt from height limits imposed across the rest of old Galt because the project application was filed at city hall before the new rules were imposed in May.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><u><font color=\"Blue\"><font size=\"4\">Condos given break on cleanup<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <b>Developer gets go-ahead to build<\/b><br \/>    December 12, 2007 <br \/>    KEVIN SWAYZE - RECORD STAFF - CAMBRIDGE<br \/>    <br \/>    City council is giving more help to a developer planning 230 luxury condominiums on a contaminated property along the Grand River.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"Red\">Waterscape on the Grand will be exempt from a city policy requiring the property be cleaned up before construction goes ahead<\/font><\/b>, council decided this week.<br \/>    <br \/>    Paul de Haas of Hasstown Holdings promised he would redevelop the whole property at Water Street North and Ainslie Street if allowed to put the heavily contaminated southern half under separate ownership.<br \/>    <br \/>    De Haas said he needs time to allow financing to proceed on the $60-million condo towers on the north side of the property.<br \/>    <br \/>    The south half, contaminated with coal tar, can be cleaned up and developed within three years, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Councillors Pam Wolf and Rick Cowsill were uncomfortable giving any more breaks to the developer.<br \/>    <br \/>    They wanted a guarantee that taxpayers won't be stuck cleaning up the site.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It is the developer who should take this risk and take the profit,\" Wolf said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city usually demands that contamination be removed from a site before allowing part of it to be transferred to a new owner.<br \/>    <br \/>    If not, the city asks for a letter of credit to cover the possible cleanup cost, should taxpayers ever be stuck with the bill.<br \/>    <br \/>    De Haas said it would be \"ludicrous\" to think his company would walk away from such a prime a location.<br \/>    <br \/>    He offered a $50,000 letter of credit, though the coal-tar cleanup is estimated to be at least $423,000.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wolf argued against giving de Haas any more city help on top of tax breaks and more than $4 million in incentives.<br \/>    <br \/>    De Haas said much of that money won't flow until the site is cleaned up, so he's motivated to follow through on his promises.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city is also paying to move a public sewer line off the property.<br \/>    <br \/>    The decision to exempt the developer from cleanup goes against a city staff recommendation.<br \/>    <br \/>    Staff wanted financial security to at least match the cost of cleanup.<br \/>    <br \/>    Council rejected that idea while approving the land severance.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun.

Grand River is one of the tallest buildings in Ontario so far to use insulating concrete form technology. <br \/>    <br \/>    It\u2019s one of the prettiest sites in Cambridge. The large, empty lot sits beside the Grand River where it tumbles over a waterfall just before flowing into downtown Galt. <br \/>    <br \/>    Developers have fancied the property for years, but the suitors soon packed their bags and left town after learning about its heritage. <br \/>    <br \/>    There\u2019s a reason that riverside lot sat abandoned for half a century. It was the original home of Galt Gas Works, a smelter that extracted coal oil from coal and eventually left carcinogens and other toxins in the ground. <br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge mayor Doug Craig says the two-acre lot on the river is one of the most attractive sites in Cambridge, but also one of the most contaminated. <br \/>    <br \/>    Developer Paul de Haas doesn\u2019t fear brownfield sites. He has converted industrial brownfield sites in the city cores of Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph and Toronto into attractive residential projects. And he\u2019s in the midst of doing just that to Cambridge\u2019s Galt Gas Works site on the Grand. <br \/>    <br \/>    A new provincial act has helped de Haas and other developers tackle such challenges. The TIF (tax increment financing) program allows municipalities to use tax dollars to encourage developers to rehabilitate contaminated sites in municipal core areas. <br \/>    <br \/>    Future property tax revenue from a cleaned-up site rehabilitated for residential or commercial use goes to the developer for a specified period or amount to offset the additional costs of the clean up. <br \/>    <br \/>    It took de Haas, president of Haastown Development Group, more than four years to get a building permit for his riverside project, but today the Waterscape condominium is rising on the site. <br \/>    <br \/>    De Haas says he could never have considered building on the Grand\u2019s east bank without the TIF program, but he adds \u201cwe really need a better attitude of co-operation between private business and the various levels of government if we are going to convert abandoned brownfields in the urban core to residential use,\u201d said de Haas. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThere are some wonderful sites that can be put to good use in the cities, but it is much easier for a developer to put housing out on green agricultural lands than it is to clean up old industrial sites,\u201d said de Haas. <br \/>    <br \/>    He said municipal politicians usually understand the financial restrictions on resurrecting contaminated sites, but says too often bureaucratic red tape and officious bureaucrats hamper or thwart the wishes of the elected officials. <br \/>    <br \/>    To get his Waterscape project underway in Cambridge de Haas gives credits Mayor Craig and Ben Tucci, the city councilor for that area. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThey were instrumental in getting the other major approval bodies in sync with one another \u2014 namely The Region of Waterloo, The Ministry of Environment, The Grand River Conservation Authority. Their efforts were extremely strong during the credit crisis in the fall of 2008 when the project financing was set to expire if all permits were not in place by Oct. 31.\u201d <br \/>    <br \/>    The 12-storey condominium will be one of the tallest buildings in the province built with insulating concrete forms (ICF). Extruded polystyrene blocks are snapped together like giant Lego blocks and concrete is poured into the form, along with reinforcing steel. The form stays on the finished wall, adding two to three inches of insulating foam on both sides. <br \/>    <br \/>    The concrete floor panels are precast off site and lifted into place by a large mobile crane on the site, said Greg Pannia, general manager at Aurora\u2019s Elite Building Group, which specializes in ICF construction. <br \/>    <br \/>    Pannia said the ICF method significantly reduces construction debris at the site, cuts the need for disposable wood framing and reduces energy required for heating and cooling the structure. <br \/>    <br \/>    Because of its location beside the Grand River de Haas hired EBS Engineering and Construction of Breslau, Ont. to drill 720 helical pilings 40 feet down to bedrock to stabilize the footings and foundation. <br \/>    <br \/>    There will be 115 suites in the building with prices starting at $159,900 for a one bedroom residence with 528 sq. ft. and ranging up to 1,405 sq. ft. for $484,900. <br \/>    <br \/>    Ciancone and de Haas plan to work together to clean up the contaminated south end of the Waterscape site. De Haas proposes a second phase of Waterscape on the south end of the property, adjacent to Ciancone\u2019s restaurant. <br \/>    <br \/>    Mayor Craig said the Waterscape project at the entrance to downtown Galt has triggered interest in rehabilitating other brownfield sites in the city core. <br \/>    <br \/>    Drayton Theatres proposes to build a 600-seat live theatre a couple blocks south of Waterscape. The new centre will also serve as the corporate headquarters for the five other theatres Drayton operates in southwestern Ontario.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110310034453\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/219-Light-Rail-Transit?p=25288#post25288\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"darkgreen\">cc LRT Letters to <a href=\"mailto:letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com\">letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/a><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-12-2010 12:34 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"2011":{"user":{"name":"jay","avatar":"\/web\/20110310034453im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=5&amp;dateline=1268703480","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Bauer Lofts, Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"667"}},"content":"I used to live by this development and they are going have some major traffic problems with this.

The only plus for this project is the view\/river.  The area sucks bad.  It's the ghetto actually. But setting that aside there is nothing around it, just a homeless shelter, a shoppers, and a student project.  You can't walk to anything other the those places and a Food basics (which only proves my point of the area).  Downtown is a hike from this and even if it wasn't there isn't anything down there anyways.<br \/>   <br \/>   I'm not a huge cambridge fan but this is a step forward and might bring some more developments but I doubt it.

A stucco finish instead of man-made stone is also an attempt to improve a busy exterior finish on the building, he said.<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <b>City staff don&#8217;t like simplifying the architectural details, nor does Pauline Todkill, a member of Heritage Cambridge.<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I don&#8217;t think these changes are insignificant,&#8221; Todkill said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The building is promoted as a landmark along the Grand River that&#8217;s intended to blend in with the historic stone and brick architecture of the area, she said. Changes would also impact the proposed second twin condominium tower planned beside it.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I shudder to think what the people from old Galt, known as the Granite City, would say to stucco,&#8221; Todkill said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Six purchasers of Waterscape condominium units sent letters to council supporting the changes, urging the city to let Waterscape get on with finishing the project.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I have sold my home and would really like to move into this Waterscape project and asking the city of Cambridge to get on with it so we can move in an enjoy our stay in Cambridge,&#8221; said Norman Hostler.<br \/>   <br \/>   Greg McDonnell said he was &#8220;greatly disappointed with the seemingly arbitrary obstacles and delays the city has thrown in the path of . . . the Waterscape project over the past four years.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   In debate last week, Coun. Gary Price was worried residents of the new condominium units didn&#8217;t know about the changes.<br \/>   <br \/>   He wasn&#8217;t swayed by what he heard Monday. He joined with Coun. Pam Wolf in voting against the changes. The rest of council endorsed the changes, so they can proceed.<br \/>   <br \/>   There&#8217;s nothing wrong with a plainer exterior finish for the Waterscape tower, said Rick Haldenby, director of the University of Waterloo school of architecture.<br \/>   <br \/>   Haldenby was part of a city-requested peer-review of the changes.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;In general I am pleased&#8221; with the revisions, he said in an email to the city.<br \/>   <br \/>   He doesn&#8217;t fret over the loss of man-made stone covering the lower four-floors of the building exterior &#8212; and notes it has been unsuccessfully attempted recently on other buildings in the region.<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"mailto:kswayze@therecord.com\">kswayze@therecord.com<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20110310034453\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/711161\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/711161<\/a>","signature":"","date":"05-13-2010 08:20 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"16"},"6712":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20110310034453im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Conurbation Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5006"}},"content":"This is why we have this stucco shit everywhere in this region!!

There were line-ups in our Expo Alley (right beside the kitchen) and at the wine bar, and a few of our guests escaped the crowd and checked out our upstairs rooms which we\u2019re also fixing up to be used as venues for special events and private gatherings.<br \/>    <br \/>    Matt Storch &amp; the Usual Suspects pumped the tunes all night and got more than a few people moving, which was great to see. We\u2019re hoping for loads of feedback about the party (it\u2019s already starting to come in) because we want our guests, our neighbours and friends to have a say in what we serve and how we serve it.

Being that I had also attended the grand opening party, I was very excited and had great expectations!  The food was delicious, but the service was lacking.  I arrived at 6:15pm Thursday and was immediately seated by the host.  It wasn't busy, mine was only the 3rd occupied table in the front section, (back section was nearly empty) and my table was the one closest to the Host Station at the front door.  I sat there for almost 15 minutes waiting for my dinner partner - and was not approached by Gastrupub staff at all.  However, during that time, the person who turned out to be our waitress tried to serve me a beer, only to find out it was ordered by a different table!<br \/>    <br \/>    Even after the my dinner partner showed up at the table, it took a further 10 minutes to be acknowledged by Gastropub staff, and that staff member was the host who had to be waved down!  Minutes after giving our drink and meal order to the host, the waitress (same person who tried to serve me a beer 15 or 20 mins earlier) came to the table and introduced herself as our server and tried to take our order.<br \/>    <br \/>    Once the order was placed, the drinks and the meal arrived in good time.  The food was very good, although we both agreed the portions were on the smallish side.  I'm not someone who insists on oversize portions that require you either to leave food on the plate or force it down so it doesn't &quot;go to waste&quot;, but I was left feeling unsatisfied after finishing my meal. This was even after we shared an appetizer and each had large draft beers.<br \/>    <br \/>    I'm certainly going to return to The 41 Gastropub because it simply could have been an isolated bad experience.  I really love the venue, the food was great tasting, and it's a great place to take visiting friends or a date! <br \/>    <br \/>    Anyone else been to The 41 Gastropub?

The places he chose may say a lot about how this region is viewed as a centre for technology and research by his administration in Washington.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known about Waterloo for quite some time, particularly about the innovation that goes on here between the business community, tech community and the universities,&#8221; Jacobson said, during an interview at the Record. &#8220;Waterloo is on the radar of every business person in the world.&#8221;<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   He described himself as &#8220;one of BlackBerry&#8217;s best customers&#8221; &#8212; and one of its first &#8212; and said the chance to meet with co-CEO Jim Balsillie at RIM&#8217;s world headquarters was a thrill. His boss, Barack Obama, is a well-known user of RIM&#8217;s smart phones.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of like going to the Holy Grail for me and my boss, the president,&#8221; Jacobson said.<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   He described his visit as a learning trip, part of his broader plan to get to know Canada better since becoming ambassador last October.<br \/>   <br \/>   Yesterday afternoon, he was given a crash course in string theory and other out-there ideas in the world of physics from the Perimeter Institute. The ambassador met with institute director Neil Turok and wanted to know about how PI&#8217;s model of bringing together experts from various backgrounds could work for similar &#8220;centres of excellence&#8221; in African nations.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I&#8217;m very interested in their efforts in math and science in Africa,&#8221; he said, before his visit.<br \/>   <br \/>   Perimeter spokesperson John Matlock said the institute is &#8220;happy to share our model with the world,&#8221; and pleased the ambassador has taken an interest in its work. But Jacobson is far from the first international visitor to want to see the region&#8217;s successful formula for combining research and innovation with commercial ventures.<br \/>   <br \/>   Jacobson&#8217;s final stop of the day was at Raytheon Canada, the company that makes all the radars used at U.S. airports. Jacobson wanted to know how the company&#8217;s high-frequency surface wave radar systems, recently bought by the Romanian government for surveillance on the Black Sea, could be used to improve American border security, said Raytheon general manager Brian Smith.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;He understood we had some very interesting technology in that sector and he wanted to see it first hand,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just on his radar, we are his radar.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Jacobson also touched on a few issues that resonate outside the region, too. He said only Canadians should decide what kind of role the country takes in Afghanistan after 2011 &#8212; and that Washington has not asked Canada to do anything beyond that.<br \/>   <br \/>   He stepped carefully on the issue, perhaps in light last month&#8217;s comments by Hillary Clinton that she was disappointed with Canada&#8217;s commitment to end its combat role next year. And he was speaking on the week that Canada lost another soldier in the Afghan mission &#8212; this one from nearby Bright, Ont.<br \/>   <br \/>   Jacobson said he&#8217;d like Canada to remain in Afghanistan, but wouldn&#8217;t say in what capacity that should be.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;The United States wants all of its coalition partners, and that includes Canada, to stay as long as they can,&#8221; the ambassador said.<br \/>   <br \/>   And he said his government has no interest in re-opening NAFTA, which may disappoint, but not surprise, those who feel the accord needs to better protect workers and the environment.<br \/>   <br \/>   Jacobson also said the U.S. has more work to do to improve efficiency at the border, though he pointed out wait times for drivers have been reduced by a third since 2006 and by half for goods.","signature":"","date":"04-14-2010 02:24 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"1"},"4684":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20101023171128im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,946    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 100","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Cool, now how do we get his boss to visit, side-trip before\/after the G8\/G20 summit? <img src=\"\/web\/20101023171128im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/tongue.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Stick Out Tongue\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    I was trying to read the ambassador's blog post regarding his visit, but it doesn't seem to be working at the moment: <a href=\"\/web\/20101023171128\/http:\/\/blogs.ottawa.usembassy.gov\/ambassador\/index.php\/2010\/04\/13\/april-13-2010-kitchener-waterloo\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/blogs.ottawa.usembassy.gov\/am...ener-waterloo\/<\/a>","signature":"","date":"04-14-2010 02:34 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"4685":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20101023171128im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,946    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 100","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"How do you get a link to start working?

I also met with Toronto Mayor David Miller and we went to the Blue Jays home opener against the White Sox. Sox won which I suppose is good news. But I&#8217;m a Cubs fan. So I&#8217;m not quite sure. <br \/>    <br \/>    At the White House I was regularly chastised for rooting for the Cubs instead of the President&#8217;s beloved White Sox. My response was always that I had not come to Washington to sell out my principles. Thought about that several times last night when people asked me to wear a Sox hat. <br \/>    <br \/>    Today I was in Kitchener-Waterloo, meeting with people at RIM (I&#8217;m a good customer) the Perimeter Institute (the home of some of the world&#8217;s leading work in theoretical physics &#8211; none of which I understood) and Raytheon to learn about radar. So I wasn&#8217;t in Washington at the Nuclear Security Summit. But I&#8217;ve been following developments there closely. <br \/>    <br \/>    As the President said, it truly is an &#8220;unprecedented gathering to address an unprecedented threat.&#8221;   The task before us is a great one.  Daunting, but imperative.  As the President observed, plutonium &#8220;the size of an apple&#8221; in the wrong hands could kill or injure hundreds of thousands of innocent people. <br \/>    <br \/>    For anyone questioning the strength of the U.S.-Canada relationship, I hope they note how our partnership leads by example.  I was pleased to see the announcement that the U.S., Canada, and Mexico will cooperate with the IAEA on the conversion of Mexico&#8217;s highly enriched uranium.  President Obama welcomed this step as a &#8220;signal of our strong trilateral partnership, and our shared commitment to nuclear security in North America.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Canada was one of the earliest countries to step up to demonstrate its strong leadership on this critical issue, by announcing yesterday its intention to transfer highly enriched uranium back to the United States. <br \/>    <br \/>    The smiles of the Prime Minister and the President as they met once again in Washington say it all.<br \/>    Prime Minister Harper &amp; President Obama, Photo courtesy of the Prime Minister's Office<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20101023171128im_\/http:\/\/blogs.ottawa.usembassy.gov\/ambassador\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/04\/Harper-and-Obama-at-Nuclear-Security-Summit-Washingotn-DC-12-April-20101-300x224.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    Prime Minister Harper &amp; President Obama, Photo courtesy of the Prime Minister's Office","signature":"","date":"04-14-2010 02:41 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"3"}}},"408":{"parent_forums":[{"forum_id":"11","forum_name":"Regional Economy and Politics"},{"forum_id":"14","forum_name":"Transportation and Infrastructure"}],"title":"Small Road &amp; Infrastructure Construction","description":"Small Road &amp; Infrastructure Construction    Road Widening, Resurfacing, General Infrastructure Improvements              http:\/\/i779.photobucket.com\/albums\/yy73\/Urbanomicon\/Miscellaneous\/RoadWorkAhead.jpg    http:\/\/mspccevents.files.wordpress.com\/2009\/06\/622729_52924098.jpg         This is a thread for general news and\/or rumors about small road and infrastructure projects.

This is while the Region still has control over roads such as Manitou (19,000 vehicles\/day), Bloomingdale (14,000), and Benton (19,170). It is not fair to Waterloo taxpayers to be responsible for Columbia Street, which clearly serves a &quot;Regional&quot; purpose, while at the same time paying for Manitou, Bloomingdale and Benton, which arguably do not serve a Regional purpose in Kitchener.

I know because I cross that intersection at least 4 times daily.

A developer with 10 years of construction and contract management experience, Momentum Development's team consistently delivers completed projects to its residents on time. <br \/>    The architect, Quadrangle is an award winning Toronto firm with an extensive portfolio including spectacular projects such as BMW's Head office, The Candy Factory Lofts, The CHUM Building, and CityGate Condominiums. <br \/>    Quadrangle approaches each project as more than a building, \"it is a cultural imprint for better living and better working, and genuinely enhances its urban environment.\" Blending homage to historical trends in architecture with the youthful and hip personality of Uptown Waterloo, the42 makes an impact. <br \/>    Locally, many are familiar with Uptown Waterloo's Whole-lotta-Gelata, a top-down invention where the Scribblers' Club team designed and managed everything from floor to ceiling. Every attention to detail mimics the colorful whimsy and joy found in a demitasse of gelato. <br \/>    Momentum Developments has engaged Scribblers' Club's expertise in creating emotive spaces for

I don't know the exact methodology in the data, and it is from the National Streetcar Coalition so it's not unbiased. It is however definitely the correct number. I'm also not sure what time period they consider, or what the consider to be &quot;private investment&quot;. I wouldn't be surprised if close to 20% of our GDP is already in the central transit corridor. It represent a significant land area, and includes just about everything of regional signifigance.<br \/>    I hear you, and I get your point, but it is correct for the data I got.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> I wouldn't be surprised either to see 20% of our GDP in the central transit corridor, in fact it's likely much higher.  However you can't look at what currently exists and then say LRT brought those industries: we need to look at what's newly predicted to happen.  For example, if $1-billion in investment is currently planned in the CTC without LRT, but after LRT is built $3-billion occurs, you wouldn't be able to claim the entire $3-billion due to transit improvements, but rather just the $2-billion difference.<br \/>    <br \/>    For timelines I was using a decade since you mentioned: &quot;For projects built in the US in the past decade (no good Canadian data), the average private investment was 22 times the government investment in LRT&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Generally a popular measure when looking at a public ROI is surrounding building permits.  For example, the City of Kitchener invested $30-million into the <a href=\"\/web\/20100530023700\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?s=f2233e070037e547ab31f22fc9e678b8&amp;t=164\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 164\">School of Pharmacy<\/a>, and as a result $40-million was invested into the <a href=\"\/web\/20100530023700\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?s=f2233e070037e547ab31f22fc9e678b8&amp;t=94\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 94\">Kaufman Lofts<\/a> and $30 million into <a href=\"\/web\/20100530023700\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?s=f2233e070037e547ab31f22fc9e678b8&amp;t=30\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 30\">The Tannery<\/a>, etc...<br \/>    <br \/>    That measure is by no means perfect, but going by it, the entire amount of Building Permits in Waterloo Region is only about $1-billion annually (side note: I can't believe I don't have a thread up on BPs yet).  It would take half a century to reach the $57-billion private investment return (actually longer since some BPs are for public projects).  That would also be assuming that everything newly built in the region will be inside the CTC, which as much as I'd like to see happen, isn't entirely realistic.<br \/>    <br \/>    I do believe LRTs bring in a huge amount of private investment, just not nearly as much as the document you're referring to states.  I'd love to find a more accurate number though, or a full breakdown\/calculation from start to finish.","signature":"","date":"04-21-2010 10:35 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"04-21-2010 10:43 PM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"22"},"5321":{"user":{"name":"mpd618","avatar":null,"title":"Senior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo, ON    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 298","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Since we're on the subject, I just want to clarify:<br \/>   <br \/>   Streetcars are to regular buses what light rail is to BRT.

Pizza (and food in general) is a beautiful, wonderful, glorious thing, and it should be respected as such.  Find yourself a fresh, handmade pizza, rolled thin and sprinkled with a thoughtful selection of choice, fresh ingredients, and you will never again considering going to places like Pizza Hut.  Anytime you can get the same meal, prepared by the two completely different people in two completely disparate places (both agro-geographically and culturally), that should really make you stop and reflect upon what kind of value that meal truly possesses.","signature":"&quot;When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, but when I ask why the poor are hungry, they call me a communist.&quot; - Dom Helder Camara","date":"06-24-2010 01:45 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"21"},"9097":{"user":{"name":"Tuuluuwag","avatar":"\/web\/20101017222929im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=368&amp;dateline=1281015260","title":"Hamlet Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jun 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 48    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"bcwessel - Couldn't agree more. <br \/>    On my honeymoon last year, I had a Pizza in Bari, Italy while we were waiting for our boat to Greece... and lemme tell you, to them it may have been nothing more than a few ingredients thrown on a bit of dough and tossed in the oven...

It has a long and successful pedigree (Charcoal Group - owner of Charcoal and Wildcraft, amongst other local places), it's participating in the urbanization of Uptown Waterloo which I heartily support, and it has a great industrial chic vibe to it inside. The decor is interesting and it seems to have less of a focus on the bar compared to Wildcraft; however, after a couple of visits I was ultimately disappointed with the single most important aspect of a restaurant - the food.<br \/>   <br \/>   My first visit (sorry, no pictures from this one) was quite acceptable - duck confit spring rolls with a spicy orange sauce were fried crispy and had a generous filling of shredded duck, and the braised short rib gnocchi was also a generous and flavourful meaty offering. It was the aftermath that wasn't so nice - a severe case of food poisoning that had me up all night. Now, one can never be 100% certain of the cause but I had nothing else strange that day so it seems that it was the likely culprit.<br \/>   <br \/>   The second visit was a lot better from my stomach's perspective, but not for my tastebuds. (Apologies for the dark pictures - it is difficult to take good pictures by candlelight with a point and shoot - but in this case it's somewhat appropriate as the flavours match the lighting).<br \/>   <br \/>   To start off, we were offered the usual bread. It was purported to be freshly baked that day, but judging from the texture, it seemed at least a day old. It set the tone for the evening though, as what followed was almost a complete disaster.<br \/>   <br \/>   First appetizer: Hand made beef short rib ravioli, truffled leek cream, red wine jus and fried shallots. ($11.95)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20101018010105im_\/http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/_yohsVylY_yg\/S3wU3f0P3MI\/AAAAAAAAEhA\/LiP2AI6TMQk\/s400\/IMG_0814.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   This was literally one big ravioli and looked a bit odd especially with the sauce running all over the plate. It was under seasoned and bland. Beef ribs should have a deep, meaty flavour but this was just completely flat and a touch dry. Same with the red wine jus, which added no punch to the flavour. The best part was the pasta which was fresh and cooked properly. I should have stuck to my vow never to order pasta at a restaurant, but was fooled by the promise of the beef short ribs this time.<br \/>   <br \/>   Second appetizer: Steak tartare with quail egg, shallots, lemon zest, capers, garlic and crostini. ($9.95)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20101018010105im_\/http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/_yohsVylY_yg\/S3wU34MPQQI\/AAAAAAAAEhI\/lY2Qnq2dzaE\/s400\/IMG_0817.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   Sapphire had the steak tartare. It had a fairly unique presentation with the spices laid out separately on the side and the egg on top, so one could presumably mix them together in a proportion that would please their palate. It wasn't a very generous serving of steak and Sapphire said the spices reminded her of the flavouring packet from instant noodles. Although considering she sometimes eats the dried noodles straight up, that might be a compliment.<br \/>   <br \/>   First main: Duck confit pizza with honey roasted pears, thyme, caramelized onions, stilton cheese and roasted garlic ($14.95)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20101018010105im_\/http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/_yohsVylY_yg\/S3wU3_a1LyI\/AAAAAAAAEhQ\/brUaTRGwDko\/s400\/IMG_0822.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   On paper this seemed to be a fairly straight-forward flavour combination, but the duck was dry and tasteless, the pears tasted like styrofoam (and not even honey roasted styrofoam), and there wasn't enough cheese to pick things up. The crust was crispy and well done though, and it appears they have a stone oven to cook pizzas in.<br \/>   <br \/>   Second main: Pan-seared Ontario duck with grilled sweet potato medallions, red pepper, wilted spinach, thyme and pear relish. ($23.95)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20101018010105im_\/http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/_yohsVylY_yg\/S3wU4XIlsNI\/AAAAAAAAEhY\/PkiYf8j6img\/s400\/IMG_0825.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   We'll often try to order dishes that we wouldn't normally cook at home - and as you might guess, duck is one of them. So we've had a lot of experience eating duck in restaurants, and this dish missed on many aspects. A well seasoned and properly seared duck breast should have a meaty, smoky flavour. This one was missing all of that, plus the fat wasn't rendered off sufficiently, ruining the texture as well as the flavour. As with all the other dishes, this was underseasoned. We thought perhaps this was for health reasons - cutting back on sodium? But alas, the spinach was swimming in butter. Other items were unremarkable, although I'm not sure quickly grilling thick slabs of sweet potato was the best idea.<br \/>   <br \/>   Dessert: Chocolate walnut brownie with silken chocolate mousse and raspberry sorbet. ($7.45)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20101018010105im_\/http:\/\/3.bp.blogspot.com\/_yohsVylY_yg\/S3wVkG7QF0I\/AAAAAAAAEhs\/ZhD5fZfEnj0\/s400\/IMG_0828.JPG\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   There is a separate pastry chef listed on the menu, and the dessert reflected it. While it was not particularly outstanding or innovative, we were simply happy at this point to be served a well executed dish. The brownie was rich, dense, and very chocolately. It paired nicely with the mousse for texture, and the raspberry sorbet for flavour contrast. It was, unfortunately, the highlight of the evening.<br \/>   <br \/>   Service was up to the standards we expected from a place like this. The front desk was overstaffed (a good thing) and we didn't have to wait for our jackets to be taken or our table. The kitchen was a little on the slow side (might explain things drying out?) but nothing outrageous.<br \/>   <br \/>   Overall, I have very mixed feelings about the dinner we had and this review. I'd really like to chalk it up to a bad day (by either the kitchen or our tastebuds) but there were so many things wrong with both visits that we'll have a hard time going back to give them a third chance. I'm sure many customers and readers will disagree, judging by the buzz and the crowds they are still attracting, but with all the options available in Waterloo now I have a hard time wanting to return.","signature":"","date":"03-12-2010 09:39 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"03-12-2010 10:55 PM","user":"TripleQ"},"num_in_thread":"6"},"2998":{"user":{"name":"uptownfoodcritic","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 92    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"I was wondering what the Sapphire Martini duo would think of the Bauer Kitchen.

When not marvelling at the glory that is Rome, I found myself watching traffic. I know it sounds weird.<br \/>    <br \/>    I even made a side trip to the Appian Way, the famous Roman road built to surprisingly modern standards 2,300 years ago. Sections are still used today, lined by ancient ruins and tombs.<br \/>    <br \/>    We chuckled at the tiny toy cars they drive. You quickly grasp why small cars make sense. There\u2019s little space for parking, urban roads are very narrow, and fuel costs twice what it does here.<br \/>    <br \/>    I never saw an SUV. A parked Dodge minivan stood out like a full-sized Hummer does here. I could never have driven my truck there.<br \/>    <br \/>    Roman drivers are experts in parallel parking. They squeeze into way-tight spaces and you wonder how they\u2019ll get out. Then you notice all the scrapes and dents on so many fenders and bodies. Here, the rust would eat your car alive. But Rome is temperate so I presume the damage can go unrepaired.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sometimes we watched tiny cars park perpendicular to the curb, in scooter spaces. Their snouts barely reached the driving lane. The parking credo seems to be: Whatever works.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cars are restricted in Rome\u2019s most popular pedestrian areas. We walked a lot so that helped. I can\u2019t see it translating here because our most popular streets have only the tiniest fraction of pedestrians by comparison.<br \/>    <br \/>    Even on wider Roman streets I didn\u2019t see many painted lanes. Cars, small trucks and lots of scooters all competed for asphalt. Drivers seemed to pay attention to each other. Vehicles would yield and merge without signs telling them when and how.<br \/>    <br \/>    The bicycle lanes I saw were segregated from traffic by a curb or painted on a sidewalk.<br \/>    <br \/>    You had to be careful and use pedestrian crosswalks near faster commuter roads. But on lower-speed urban streets you could often step into the lane and drivers would stop for you, without leaning on horns.<br \/>    <br \/>    My sense is that Roman drivers tend to view roads as shared spaces in which everyone uses their best judgment. That\u2019s how I hope roundabouts will work here, to make us better drivers.<br \/>    <br \/>    It may sound and look like traffic chaos.

They even warn us about light pollution. Here\u2019s one more to add to the environmental list: sign pollution. We\u2019re lost in a forest of signage.<br \/>    <br \/>    What, you might ask, is wrong with a stop sign? Nothing, when needed, but the stop sign is now the default resolution to any and all traffic problems (second only to speed bumps). It\u2019s simple for local planners and politicians (and most road regulation is done at the local level) to throw up a stop sign any time they don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s an easy fix. Have you got a street in need of a real solution but lack the will or smarts? Throw up a stop sign or better yet a four-way stop. Problem solved.<br \/>    <br \/>    This pat answer has a troubling effect. We become inured to the signs erected to save us. John Straddon, an emeritus professor at Duke University in North Carolina, has been vociferous in his condemnation of the North American approach to road safety. Stop signs, he argued in a 2008 article in the Atlantic Monthly, are placed off to the side of the road, often hidden by trees (not in front of the driver where he should be looking). \u201cStop signs are costly to drivers and bad for the environment,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStopping and starting uses more gas and vehicles pollute most when starting from rest.\u201d    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> I should add that few drivers who stop at a STOP sign actually stop where they're legally supposed to -- before the STOP sign, not into the pedestrian crossing or even into the intersection.<br \/>    <br \/>    <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tCurrently there are two popular methods for dealing with stop signs. Some motorists observe them with obsessive scrupulousness. They come to full, vigorous stops. Wait, even if no one is around, and then plod on. These folks are annoying beyond description but not dangerous.<br \/>    <br \/>    Others ignore stop signs entirely. It is now common to watch cars cruise through stop signs obliviously. The legendary \u201cCalifornia Roll\u201d or \u201cHollywood Stop\u201d in which the driver cruises slowly through a stop sign was once a rare occurrence on Canadian streets but is now the norm. While this move feels safe for the driver it is fairly dangerous. For instance, when the \u201croller\u201d glides through a stop turning right, he generally looks left (scanning for oncoming traffic) not right as he should be.

We merely obey. Human judgment and skill get lost. Driving becomes robotic and inefficient. The worst side-effect of the stop sign glut is that it causes drivers to be less aware of cross traffic when driving. The responsibility shifts from the driver to the sign. \u201cThey look for signs,\u201d Staddon observed, \u201cand drive according to what the signs tell them to do.\u201d    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> And even so, the more robotic the driver the more likely they are to miss the STOP altogether.<br \/>    <br \/>    <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tThe Solution? Staddon wants to replace the four-way stop with roundabouts (common in Europe) and to emulate the \u201cnaked streets\u201d wave that has been employed in 30 communities in Holland. This involved removing as many signs as possible and making motorists, cyclists and pedestrians actively share the road. No one has the right of way and everybody slows downs and drives smarter.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> By jove!

Europeans, it\u2019s fair to say, take driving very seriously. It\u2019s much more difficult to get your driver\u2019s license and owning a car in Europe is a status symbol. In North America, it\u2019s a sign you need to get from Point A to Point B. Progressive European motoring solutions reflect this investment in car culture. Mindless North American solutions reflect the love-hate relationship we have with the automobile. We love cars but are ashamed to admit it.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> Yup.

During the mornings, heading into Waterloo and heading back during the evening. There is definitely more traffic on the kitchener end. The Waterloo bottleneck as much due to the volume as to drivers trying to jump the queue. If drivers wouldn't use the collectors as a quick way to pass and take them all the way to almost the Lancaster overpass only to squeeze in and slam on their brakes it would work quite well and the speed in the core lanes would not be affected. The speed quickly increases right past the Lancaster overpass. And cars coming on from Lancaster do not slow things down much more. On the other end many times the traffic is backed up over highway 8. And traffic coming in from highway 8 helps feed this more. The right lane exiting at Courtland is often used by inconsiderate drivers for queue jumping in the same way as the collectors to the east. Unlike the Lancaster area the speed does not increase much past Courtland. There is a substancial amount of traffic entering the highway at Courtland and many cars exiting at Homer Watson, often the slowest part of the drive home is in the two lane westbound section immediately after the Courtland interchange.  <br \/>   <br \/>   This work defintely needs to be done, but I do agree that the Waterloo end needs upgrades too, I can see it getting much worse once the new highway 7 is built, a freeway to freeway interchange removes the ramp metering effect that the current signal controlled interchanges have on the flow of traffic onto the highway.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> Part of these congestion patterns come from many people living in south, west, and south-west Kitchener and commuting into Waterloo.

This absolutely needs to balance out and Waterloo put more of an emphasis on residential development and Kitchener open up more employment lands such as through a new industrial park, etc. Again, this is not fair to taxpayers of both cities, especially Waterloo.

It's too easy when you promote urban development to just say &quot;more, more, more&quot;. But funding is limited, and some funding achieves better outcomes than other funding. The 100 million dollars it's going to cost to widen just a few kilometers of the Conestoga Parkway could build the University Ave streetcar. Just look at how cheap Portland has been building streetcars. Streetcars are significantly better at promoting re-urbanization, are more popular with riders, are more comfortable, and will be cheaper to run when peak oil happens. Streetcar infrastructure lasts 100 years or more; there's legitimate debate about how much oil we have left, but it sure isn't 100 years worth.<br \/>     <br \/>    <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110209234110im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>Ken_Breadbox<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110209234110\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=6005#post6005\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110209234110im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">Speaking as someone who lived in London for 10 years before coming here in 1990--and who did his grade thirteen independent study project on London's traffic situation (what I geek I was!), I can tell you then even twenty years ago, there was lots of kvetching and moaning London's grid, which was usually locked even then.

Whatever is picked as a &#8220;preferred option&#8221; will go to a public meeting in the spring, said Wayne Cheater, the Waterloo Region engineering group overseeing a $200,000 study. A meeting date hasn&#8217;t been set.<br \/>    <br \/>    The region has $2.5 million set aside in 2013 for road work in the area.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cheater&#8217;s team has looked at upgrading roads outside of the study area, to move traffic away from the winding bottleneck, but that&#8217;s unlikely to make much of a difference, he said. It comes down to making the best of what&#8217;s there.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We really haven&#8217;t come up with magic bullet,&#8221; Cheater said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The historic properties constrain us. The slopes are still there. The river is there.The railway is there.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Tuesday at 6:45 a.m., another crash happened in the study area: a pickup truck hit a pole near the entrance of Riverside Park. Police report minor injuries.<br \/>    <br \/>    From 2003 to 2007, regional staff say 202 collisions were reported in the study area. That&#8217;s more than double the 79 traffic computer models predict should have happened if there weren&#8217;t problems. <br \/>    <br \/>    Trouble spots weren&#8217;t at the three stoplights along King at Shantz Hill, Fountain and Eagle. It was King between Fountain and the park entrance, with 63 crashes where 14 were expected. Then there was the King intersection with Chopin Drive, with 32 crashes where five were predicted.<br \/>    <br \/>    A committee of staff and politicians meets in Kitchener today to pick a preferred traffic fix option, said Cambridge Coun. Karl Kiefer. He sits on the region project committee, representing Cambridge city council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Whatever the region wants to do, it will need to expropriate property, he said. And he&#8217;s certain a long-talked about bridge across the Speed River between King and Hamilton streets won&#8217;t happen.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s going to fly. You&#8217;re heading right into a heavy residential area,&#8221; Kiefer said.<br \/>    <br \/>    He wouldn&#8217;t object to a roundabout at King and Fountain to keep traffic flowing, but that will take continued public education to work well.<br \/>    <br \/>    Whatever happens at King and Fountain, Kiefer wants the region to work closely with adjoining property owners looking to redevelop the area.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It&#8217;s the most often asked questions I get. What&#8217;s happening with Preston Springs? What&#8217;s going on with the Kress site?&#8217;&#8217;<br \/>    <br \/>    At the northeast corner, Faisal Susiwala proposes a commercial-condominum-hotel project on the former site of the Kress hotel. He was unavailable Tuesday to comment on the status of the project.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitty corner is the historic Preston Springs Gardens, which has sat vacant for two decades after it closed as a retirement home. Aborted redevelopment plans ended up in legal spat that&#8217;s taken years to sort out.<br \/>    <br \/>    No plans are imminent for the landmark building, said Alan Hodge, a spokesperson for redevelopment there.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It&#8217;s only just got out of court.

The main reasons for this alternative being preferred is that it is deemed best from a traffic and safety standpoint, and does not require the removal of any designated or listed heritage structures. In addition, Alternative Design Concepts 1, 4 and 5 with traditional intersection improvements at Fountain Street\/Shantz Hill require the removal of the existing Travel Agency building at the foot of Shantz Hill and are therefore considered not feasible.<br \/>    The project team also recognized that Alternative Design Concept 2 - Realigned intersection at Fountain Street\/Shantz Hill and King Street\/Fountain Street, with traditional intersection improvements at King Street\/Eagle Street &#8211; was also feasible but technically less preferred due to less projected traffic and safety improvements than Alternative Design Concept 6.<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Transportation\/FountainStreetandKingStreetClassEAS.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Transportation\/FountainStreetandKingStreetClass-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Transportation\/FountainStreetandKingStreetClass-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"","date":"03-10-2010 12:33 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"2831":{"user":{"name":"Urbanomicon","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=99&amp;dateline=1266346234","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, Ontario","member_since":"Feb 2010","num_posts":"1000"}},"content":"<font size=\"5\"><font color=\"blue\">Roundabout plan for King-Fountain costs $15 million<\/font><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>   March 10, 2010 <br \/>   By Kevin Swayze, Record staff<br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232250\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/681820\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/681820<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>   CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Rose Cole fears a big roundabout at King and Fountain streets will be overwhelmed with afternoon rush hour traffic from a growing city industrial park to the north.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cPeople will just be parked there in the afternoon, with all the traffic from Toyota and Loblaws and now RIM,\u201d she said at a public information session Tuesday night.<br \/>    <br \/>   She drives the single-lane roundabout at Blair and Fountain streets weekday mornings, on the way to Conestoga College. It\u2019s usually clogged with traffic by 7 a.m., with no gaps for more cars to sneak in.<br \/>   \u201cI\u2019m now there early, so I can beat it,\u201d she said.<br \/>    <br \/>   For her and others clustered around maps in the King Street Baptist Church hall, a roundabout in front of the historic Preston Springs hotel was overkill. Several people suggested widening the King-Fountain intersection so it\u2019s big enough to easily handle trucks and keep the stoplights.<br \/>    <br \/>   People were lined up outside before the doors opened at 5 p.m. At least 125 people stopped in to look over drawings and maps before it closed at 8:30 p.m.<br \/>    <br \/>   Waterloo Region is nearing the end of an environmental assessment of options to fix the bottleneck entrance to old Preston. The winding road is hemmed in by commercial and heritage buildings, the Speed River bridge and must swallow transport trucks backing into and out of Dover Flour Mills.<br \/>   The preferred solution includes sidewalks and on-road bike lanes along both sides of Shantz Hill, <br \/>   Fountain and King Streets. It also includes likely demolition of part of the Pines banquet centre.<br \/>    <br \/>   More investigation into limiting left-turn lanes from Chopin Drive onto King are planned, at the request of Cambridge city officials, said Wayne Cheater, project manager.<br \/>    <br \/>   As proposed, the plan costs upwards of $15 million. Regional politicians are expected to decide what will be done later this year. Even with speedy approval this year, any rebuilding couldn\u2019t get underway until 2015, Cheater said.<br \/>    <br \/>   Tim Krete doubted the plan for a roundabout and rejigged intersection at Shantz Hill Road would improve traffic flow.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cAll that seems to be happening is they\u2019re spending a lot of money for nothing,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>   His solution is closing Fountain Street at Highway 401. That forces all traffic to and from the industrial park around the Toyota factory to use already upgraded routes like Maple Grove Road, Hespeler Road and Highway 8 to reach Highway 401. Or motorists would avoid the area altogether.<br \/>    <br \/>   Shirley Bowman shared Krete\u2019s doubts about the roundabout plan \u2014 or any other solution to erase King Street traffic jams like the one that greeted visitors heading to the church.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cI think they came up with proposals because they had to come up with proposals,\u201d said the co-ordinator of the Preston Towne Centre business improvement association.<br \/>    <br \/>   The proposal swings Shantz Hill Road to the right going downhill, then sweeping four lanes of asphalt left to join Fountain Street. Two-lane Fountain Street from Blair would meet the curving intersection with stoplights, as are there now.<br \/>    <br \/>   Lloyd Closs lives in a house beside the historic Jerry van Dyke Travel building, at the foot of Shantz Hill. He\u2019s sure the new intersection will lop off much of his front yard for no good reason.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cI can see them putting in the roundabout, but not doing anything to Shantz Hill ... it\u2019s fine the way it is.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>   The roundabout had fans in Glenn and Anna Dance, five-year residents of the Kressview condominium tower that has its only driveway onto King near Fountain. <br \/>    <br \/>   Today, making a left turn onto King is dangerous to the uninitiated. A roundabout would remove that danger and get traffic moving through the area, they said. <br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cIt\u2019s just super for us. We would just go right and around the roundabout and go where we wanted to go,\u201d said Glenn Dance.<br \/>    <br \/>   <i><a href=\"mailto:kswayze@therecord.com\">kswayze@therecord.com<\/a><\/i>","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

In addition, Alternative Design Concepts 1, 4 and 5 with Conventional intersection improvements at Fountain Street\/Shantz Hill require the removal of the existing Travel Agency building at the foot of Shantz Hill and were therefore considered not feasible.<br \/>    The Project Team also recognized that:<ul><li>Design Concept 2 - Realigned intersection at Fountain Street\/Shantz Hill and King Street\/Fountain Street, with Conventional intersection improvements at King Street\/Eagle Street &#8211; was also feasible but technically less preferred due to less projected traffic and safety improvements than Design Concept 6.<\/li>   <li>Design Concept 3 - Realigned intersection at Fountain Street\/Shantz Hill with Conventional intersection improvements King Street\/Fountain Street, and at King Street\/Eagle Street &#8211; was also feasible but technically less preferred due to less projected traffic and safety improvements than Design Concept 6 and Design Concept 2.<\/li>   <\/ul>Public comments received from the consultation meeting are generally supportive of the evaluation of alternatives, but there remain some concerns regarding driver behaviour in roundabouts, traffic operations at roundabouts, pedestrian safety in crossing at roundabouts, changes to the historic road patterns, property impacts, and property access changes.<br \/>    <br \/>    Design Concept 6 will be presented as the Project Team&#8217;s Preferred Design Alternative at the Public Input Meeting (PIM) for the Fountain Street &#8211; King Street Improvements project to be held on June 8, 2010 at 7:00 p.m. at King Street Baptist Church, 361 King Street East, Cambridge, to solicit comments from the general public and other stakeholders regarding the proposed improvements and potential impacts. Following the PIM, the Project Team will review comments received and report back to Regional Planning and Works Committee with responses and identification of a Recommended Alternative for approval by Regional Council in the Fall of 2010. Subject to approval by Regional Council, the Environmental Study Report for the project will be filed for a 30-day public review and subsequent approval by the Ministry of Environment.<br \/>    <br \/>    <object codebase=\"\/web\/20110207232250oe_\/http:\/\/download.macromedia.com\/pub\/shockwave\/cabs\/flash\/swflash.cab#version=9,0,0,0\" id=\"embedded_flash_2188154_mzztx_object\" name=\"embedded_flash_2188154_mzztx_object\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" align=\"middle\"\theight=\"550\" width=\"100%\"><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"&amp;document_id=32654256&amp;access_key=key-101jfeel9t8lvxwjd5fq&amp;page\">\t\t<param name=\"movie\"\tvalue=\"http:\/\/documents.scribd.com\/ScribdViewer.swf\"> \t\t<param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\"> \t\t<param name=\"play\" value=\"true\">\t\t<param name=\"loop\" value=\"true\"> \t\t<param name=\"scale\" value=\"showall\">\t\t<param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"> \t\t<param name=\"devicefont\" value=\"false\">\t\t<param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#ffffff\"> \t\t<param name=\"menu\" value=\"true\">\t\t<param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"> \t\t<param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\"> \t\t<param name=\"salign\" value=\"\">\t\t<embed flashvars=\"&amp;document_id=32654256&amp;access_key=key-101jfeel9t8lvxwjd5fq&amp;page\" src=\"\/web\/20110207232250oe_\/http:\/\/documents.scribd.com\/ScribdViewer.swf\" quality=\"high\" pluginspage=\"http:\/\/www.macromedia.com\/go\/getflashplayer\" play=\"true\" loop=\"true\" scale=\"showall\" wmode=\"opaque\" devicefont=\"false\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" name=\"embedded_flash_2188154_mzztx_object\" menu=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" salign=\"\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" align=\"middle\" height=\"500\" width=\"100%\"><\/embed><\/object>    \t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110207232250\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"06-07-2010 11:52 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"12"},"8280":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5291"}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Roundabout panned in front of historic Preston Springs Gardens hotel<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    June 09, 2010<br \/>    By Kevin Swayze, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/media.therecord.topscms.com\/images\/3e\/df\/7b03ac6b441abf763fe24eb1a120.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    CAMBRIDGE \u2014 Build a big roundabout at the intersection of King and Fountains streets, and all you\u2019ll do is pile on traffic misery onto the historic crossroads and into downtown Preston, several people told a public meeting Tuesday evening.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cAdding a roundabout will turn it into a very friendly truck route,\u201d said John Duncan of Fountain Street North. \u201cThat means more traffic. Keep it unfriendly to trucks.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Jerry Van Dyke owns a travel store at the bottom of Shantz Hill. Instead of trying to push more traffic down Shantz Hill and along Fountain and King streets, he suggested reviving the long-talked-about western bypass around Cambridge. He scoffed at the idea of eagles along the Grand River killing any hope for a bypass. \u201cThe eagles would get used to it.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    If not a bypass, Van Dyke argued, Waterloo Region should build a bridge from the foot of Shantz Hill across the Speed River behind the Dover flour mills to hook in with King Street. Avoid the Fountain-King bottleneck entirely, he argued.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional staff say traffic analysis shows a bridge would move traffic through the area no more effectively than a roundabout, but cause a huge environmental impact.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city should offer Dover a new industrial property, Van Dyke said, to get all the company\u2019s traffic-clogging transport trucks off King Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional Coun. Jane Brewer \u2014 a former Cambridge mayor \u2014 said Cambridge tried a land swap years ago, but the company wasn\u2019t interested. Instead, the company expanded along the Speed River, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional traffic staff propose building a two-lane roundabout at King and Fountain, along with rejigging the Shantz Hill-Fountain intersection slightly westward, and adding extra turn lanes at the intersection of King and Eagle streets. The project would cost $15 million. Work is proposed in 2014, after three years of property purchases and pre-construction work.<br \/>    <br \/>    About 75 people attended a meeting of the region\u2019s planning and works committee, held in the hall of King Street Baptist Church, situated near the area in question. No decisions were made at the meeting \u2014 that comes at regional council in the fall.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThis is not a done deal yet,\u201d said committee chair Jim Wideman.<br \/>    <br \/>    Heritage boosters don\u2019t like stuffing a modern roundabout into the heart of a picture-postcard vista that defines old Preston.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most historic intersection in the Region of Waterloo,\u201d said Al Junker, of the region\u2019s heritage advisory committee.<br \/>    <br \/>    Both the city and regional heritage committees want as little change as possible for the intersection, and especially do not want to see a roundabout there.<br \/>    <br \/>    Derek Bowman of Fountain Street South was one of the few people at the meeting supporting a roundabout, so long as it fits the historic character of the area. Why not use cobblestones instead of concrete, making it blend with the old buildings, he wondered.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cTurn this into a win-win for everyone, not just for traffic,\u201d Bowman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    A roundabout would take the best land available for redevelopment at vacant 250 King St. E., said planner Victor Labreche, speaking for the owners of the former Kress Hotel site.<br \/>    <br \/>    Widen the intersection instead, he said. A roundabout would also scuttle any chance of a co-operative redevelopment including the vacant historic Preston Springs Gardens hotel.<br \/>    <br \/>    Residents of the Kressview condominium tower are wary of the roundabout at their driveway onto King Street. If it is built, they want a long-promised driveway to Fountain Street built as part of the project to give them another access, said John Waring, spokesperson for the condominium board.<br \/>    <br \/>    Jennifer Montague said all the talk about a big roundabout has hurt her business, the Pines banquet hall at the King-Fountain intersection. Customers think the building will be razed to make way for the roundabout and won\u2019t book future weddings and functions, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:kswayze@therecord.com\">kswayze@therecord.com<\/a><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232250\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/725106\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/725106<\/a>","signature":"","date":"06-09-2010 09:41 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"13"},"8832":{"user":{"name":"Urbanomicon","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232250im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=99&amp;dateline=1266346234","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, Ontario","member_since":"Feb 2010","num_posts":"1000"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Cambridge Council Meeting Monday, June 21, 2010<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Council Chambers, Cambridge City Hall 7:00 p.m.<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232250\/http:\/\/www.cambridge.ca\/cs_pubaccess\/download_minutes.php?doc_id=5823\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <b>PRESENTATIONS<\/b><br \/>    Wayne Cheater and Steve Van De Keere, Region of Waterloo Transportation, re: King St.\/Fountain St. Improvements - Environmental Assessment Study Project Recommendations.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <font size=\"5\"><font color=\"blue\">King and Fountain streets roundabout plan goes to Cambridge council Monday<\/font><\/font><br \/>    June 19, 2010 | Record staff | <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232250\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/731832\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/731832<\/a><br \/>     <br \/>    CAMBRIDGE &#8212; Plans for a $15-million roundabout at King and Fountain streets goes to city council for review Monday.<br \/>     <br \/>     Waterloo Region officials propose the traffic circle in front of the empty Preston Springs Hotel, along with rejigging of Shantz Hill Road at Fountain Street and widening of the King-Fountain intersection.

The first phase, from Cherry Blossom Road to approximately 150 metres west of Fountain Street, will be completed in 2010. The second phase, from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, is currently in the detailed design phase and is scheduled to be constructedin 2013. The third phase, from Speedsville Road to Hespeler Road, is currently scheduled to be constructed in 2016. The intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove is currently controlled by traffic control signals. Based on forecasted 2024 traffic volumes, the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street requires significant capacity improvements in order to provide an acceptable level-of-service for traffic operations. Options available to provide the required capacity improvements include: (i) Construct dual left-turn lanes on three (3) of the four (4) intersection approaches as well as a designated right-turn lane on all four (4) approaches or (ii) Construct a modern three-lane roundabout in lieu of traffic control signals. In accordance with Regional policy (adopted April 9, 2003), staff has undertaken an Intersection Control Study to make a comparative analysis of a modern roundabout and traffic control signals atthe intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Staff has also consulted with property owners abutting this intersection to present the options and to obtain feedback. Based on the results of technical studies, the current operating experience with the Region&#8217;s thirteen (13) roundabouts, input received from abutting property owners and staff observations at several multi-lane roundabouts in the United States, staff is recommending that the Region construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, currently scheduled for construction in 2013. The Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program includes funding of $7,900,000 in years 2010-2014 inclusive for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including improvements to the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. The estimated total capital cost to construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is $4,825,000 compared to an estimated total capital cost of $3,417,000 to construct a signalized intersection with dual leftturn lanes and channelized right-turn lanes; however, an overall lifecycle cost analysis (which includes the societal cost of accidents) has concluded that constructing a three-lane roundabout is recommended over constructing traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Based on this preliminary $4,825,000 cost estimate for the proposed roundabout, the total project budget of $7,900,000 for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road is sufficient to construct a modern three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road. Staff will reassess this total project budget requirement as part of the 2011 budget process.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>REPORT:<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <b>1. Background<\/b><br \/>    The widening of Maple Grove Road from two (2) to four (4) lanes from Cherry Blossom Road to Hespeler Road in the City of Cambridge is currently programmed in the Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program to be completed in three (3) stages from 2010 to 2016. The first phase, from Cherry Blossom Road to approximately 150 metres west of Fountain Street, will be constructed to base course asphalt level in 2010. The second phase, from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, is currently in the detailed design phase and is scheduled to be constructed in 2013. The third phase, from Speedsville Road to Hespeler Road, is currently scheduled to be constructed in 2016. The intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is currently controlled by traffic control signals. (Please refer to Appendix &#8220;A&#8221; for a Key Plan.) Recently completed traffic studies indicate that traffic volumes at this intersection are projected to increase from 24,000 vehicles per day in 2009 to 55,000 vehicles per day by 2024. In order to address this projected growth in traffic, the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street requires significant capacity improvements in order to provide an acceptable level-of-service for traffic operations. Options available to provide the required capacity improvements include: (i) Construct dual left-turn lanes on three (3) of the four (4) intersection approaches as well as a designated right-turn lane on all four (4) approaches or (ii) Construct a modern three-lane roundabout in lieu of traffic control signals. Please refer to Appendix &#8220;B&#8221; for a drawing of the conventional intersection design for this intersection with traffic control signals and to Appendix &#8220;C&#8221; for a drawing of a roundabout design for this intersection.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>2. Comparison of Traffic Control Signals and a Modern Roundabout<\/b><br \/>    In accordance with Regional policy (adopted April 9, 2003), staff has undertaken an Intersection Control Study (ICS) to make a comparative analysis of a modern roundabout and traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. In order to complete the ICS, a preliminary design was completed for the proposed roundabout in order to determine its required configuration, lane requirements, property impacts and construction cost. Based on projected traffic volumes, the roundabout requires two (2) lanes of traffic initially and three (3) lanes of traffic by 2018 to provide an adequate level-of-service for traffic operations. Since 2018 is only five (5) years beyond the proposed construction timing of 2013, staff has based the comparative analysis on constructing the roundabout initially with three (3) lanes in 2013 to avoid retrofit costs, which are estimated to be approximately $847,000, to widen the roundabout from two (2) to three (3) lanes in 2018. The results of the ICS comparing traffic control signals to a three (3) lane roundabout are summarized below. Estimated present value costs for each alternative have been calculated using  a 6% discount rate.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street<br \/>    20-Year Cost Comparison and Overall Assessment of Traffic Control Signals and a Roundabout (Present Value)<\/b><br \/>    Estimated Cost | Traffic Control Signals | Roundabout<br \/>    Construction | $3,417,000 | $4,825,000<br \/>    Maintenance (signals) | $22,000 | 0<br \/>    Injury Crash Cost | $2,650,000 | $640,000<br \/>    Additional Street lighting &amp; Annual Maintenance | $4,000 | $34,000<br \/>    Total (Present Value) | $6,093,000 | $5,499,000<br \/>    Expected Average Number of Injury Collisions Per Year | 7.70 | 1.86<br \/>    Operational Performance in 2024 (based on forecast 2024 traffic volumes) | Level of Service (LOS) D | Level of Service (LOS) A<br \/>    Overall Assessment | | Preferred<br \/>    <br \/>    Based on this assessment, the present value cost over a 20-year period of a three (3) lane roundabout is estimated to be $594,000 lower than the cost of conventional road improvements with traffic control signals. Additionally, a roundabout is expected to provide significantly improved traffic operational performance and reduced injury collision frequency and costs compared to traffic control signals. Based on this comparison, staff have assessed that a modern three (3) lane roundabout is preferred over traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road from operational, cost and safety perspectives. Staff notes that there is a high percentage of truck traffic on Maple Grove Road (approximately 16%). A three (3) lane roundabout would permit two heavy trucks (tractor-trailers) to pass through the roundabout side-by-side concurrently while using the full width of the three (3) available lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>3. Public Consultation<\/b><br \/>    There are five properties that directly abut the proposed modern roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street. These properties are owned by:<br \/>    i) Toyota Canada;<br \/>    ii) Loblaw Properties Limited;<br \/>    iii) D5D Developments;<br \/>    iv) Camrock Developments Corporation; and<br \/>    v) Simon Poladian.<br \/>    The Region will need to acquire property from each of the abutting property owners in order to construct the proposed roundabout. Please refer to Appendix &#8220;C&#8221; for a drawing illustrating the proposed three-lane roundabout and the property acquisition required by the Region in order to construct the roundabout. All five property owners were contacted by Regional staff to arrange an individual meeting to view drawings of the proposed roundabout and to provide an opportunity for the property owners to ask questions and to provide feedback regarding the proposed roundabout. Staff met with representatives of Toyota Canada, D5D Developments and Camrock Developments. Despite numerous attempts, staff was not successful in arranging a direct meeting with Loblaw Properties Limited and Simon Poladian. Staff sent these two property owners a letter accompanied by a drawing of the proposed roundabout and requested that they provide any comments. To date, staff has not received a response from either property owner. The representatives of abutting properties that were able to meet with staff did not express any concerns with regard to the permanent implementation of a proposed three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street or the sale of required property to the<br \/>    Region. Representatives of Toyota Canada expressed some concern regarding the impacts of construction of a roundabout on traffic movement through the intersection and the extent of expected delays during the construction period. Staff reviewed the proposed construction staging plans for the roundabout with each property representative. The construction staging plans will require the contractor to maintain one through lane of traffic in both directions and left-turn lanes on both Maple Grove Road and Fountain during construction. The proposed construction plan includes four separate stages. Please refer to Appendices &#8220;D1 to D4&#8221; for drawings of the proposed construction stages. Staff indicated to the property representative that some traffic delays during construction would be unavoidable; however, the representatives generally acknowledged that the proposed traffic staging should minimize the extent of traffic delays through the intersection during construction to the extent possible. Staff also noted that one lane of traffic in each direction would be maintained on Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street during construction of the road widening from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road. Staff also delivered approximately 325 letters on March 9, 2010 to area property owners along Maple Grove Road (from Highway 8 to Hespeler Road), Saltsman Drive (entire length), Cherry Blossom Road (entire length), Fountain Street (from Middle Block Road to Highway 401), Speedsville Road (from Middle Block Road to Highway 401), Beaverdale Road (from Middle Block Road to Hespeler Road), Allendale Road (Riverbank Drive to Fountain Street), Reuter Drive (entire length) and Royal Oak Road (entire length) advising them of all proposed improvements to Maple Grove Road from 2010 to 2016 including the consideration of a proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street. To date, staff has not received any inquiries or comments about a proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street as a result of this letter. Additionally, letters were sent on May 4, 2010 advising the five property owners abutting the proposed roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street that the Region&#8217;s Planning and Works Committee will consider a staff report May 18, 2010 recommending the construction of a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street in conjunction with the proposed widening of Maple Grove Road from Fountain Street to Speedsville Road currently scheduled for construction in 2013.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>5. Recommended Alternative<\/b><br \/>    Based on the technical studies completed, the current operating experience with the Region&#8217;s 13 roundabouts, input received from the adjacent property owners that directly abut the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street, and staff observations at several multi-lane roundabouts in the United States, staff believe the roundabout is a better option than traffic control signals for the intersection of Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street because:<ul><li>The 20-year present value cost of a roundabout is less than traffic control signals;<\/li>   <li>A roundabout is expected to result in fewer injury collisions and costs; and<\/li>   <li>A roundabout is expected to result in fewer delays to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.<\/li>   <\/ul>A roundabout would also result in fuel savings and a reduction in vehicle emissions. The proposed roundabout would also provide an opportunity for aesthetic streetscape enhancements that would not be possible with a signalized intersection. As projected traffic volumes warrant a three (3) lane roundabout in 2018, or five (5) years after the proposed timing for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road in 2013, staff is recommending that a three (3) lane roundabout be constructed initially in 2013 in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN:<\/b> As part of the Region&#8217;s Strategic Focus, this project satisfies Focus Area 2: Growth Management, Manage and shape growth to ensure a livable, healthy, thriving and sustainable Waterloo Region, and Focus Area 1: Environmental Sustainability, Protect and enhance the environment by improving air quality and protecting the environment. The proposed roundabout would result in shorter queues and would therefore reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The proposed roundabout would also satisfy Focus Area 5: Infrastructure, Provide high quality infrastructure and asset management to meet current needs and future growth.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:<\/b><br \/>    The Region&#8217;s approved 2010 Ten Year Transportation Capital Program includes funding of $7,900,000 in years 2010-2014 inclusive for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road, including improvements to the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. The estimated total capital cost to construct a three-lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road is $4,825,000 compared to an estimated total capital cost of $3,417,000 to construct a signalized intersection with dual leftturn lanes and channelized right-turn lanes; however, an overall lifecycle cost analysis (which includes the societal cost of accidents) has concluded that constructing a three-lane roundabout is recommended over constructing traffic control signals at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road. Based on this preliminary $4,825,000 cost estimate for the proposed roundabout, the total project budget of $7,900,000 for the widening of Maple Grove Road from 150 metres west of Fountain Street to Speedsville Road is sufficient to construct a modern three (3) lane roundabout at the intersection of Fountain Street and Maple Grove Road in conjunction with the widening of Maple Grove Road.

Do they know what they\u2019re doing there?\u2019\u201d said Coun. Jane Brewer of Cambridge. <br \/>     <br \/>    The latest approval is for a three-lane roundabout at Maple Grove Road and Fountain Street in Cambridge. It\u2019s planned for 2013 when Maple Grove Road is widened to four lanes. <br \/>     <br \/>    Regional councillors approved it Tuesday and then wondered: How come they keep hearing the same complaints, over and over, that roundabouts aren\u2019t meant for big trucks or pedestrians? <br \/>     <br \/>    \u201cBecause it\u2019s a change in how we do things, these questions keep coming up,\u201d Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig said. \u201cI think we need to answer that better.\u201d <br \/>     <br \/>    Councillors agreed, directing staff to prepare another document or brochure explaining why roundabouts make sense for all vehicles and uses. They want the document to explore collision statistics for different users and explain how roundabouts reduce long-term injury costs. <br \/>     <br \/>    \u201cWe have to be careful that it\u2019s not too technical,\u201d said Coun. Claudette Millar of Cambridge.<br \/>     <br \/>    Councillors also agreed, at the urging of Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, to consider holding a philosophical debate on their long-term roundabout commitment.<br \/>     <br \/>    Regional council has installed 13 roundabouts on commuter roads since 2004 and has approved at least 18 more, on the assertion that traffic flows more smoothly and more safely through the circles. <br \/>     <br \/>    Local cities have built roundabouts on city streets and regional government has more roundabouts under review. <br \/>     <br \/>    This has put motorists on a sharp learning curve. Local results show roundabouts are generating more fender-benders but fewer injuries than signalized intersections.<br \/>     <br \/>    Roundabouts are designed so large trucks can straddle the lanes. Motorists are advised to wait and let trucks get through the circles. <br \/>     <br \/>    Coun. Jim Wideman, of Kitchener, estimates up to 80 per cent of drivers are OK with roundabouts but some critics will never be persuaded. \u201cThere are more believers than non-believers,\u201d he said. <br \/>     <br \/>    He figures concerns about large trucks in the circles are often raised \u201cas a stalling tactic\u201d by critics who don\u2019t want a roundabout.","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

Any new sidewalks or bicycle lanes would have to be funded by the municipality.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The ministry is aware that Cambridge and Waterloo Region are reviewing crossing options for pedestrians and cyclists between Franklin Boulevard and Hespeler Road.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The issue returned to the headlines in October when a cyclist was killed near the Franklin Boulevard exit ramp.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The 401 expansion plans include a 12-lane core and collector stretch between Highway 6 north and south that would accommodate a bypassed Highway 6 around the village of Morriston, south of the 401.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">&#8220;It will be there when we come along to do our project,&#8221; Leake said.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Once a preferred plan is selected, a second round of public information sessions will be held, likely next summer.

Rick Cowsill called for signs to warn exiting drivers to slow down, before any other pedestrians or cyclists are killed on Franklin Boulevard between the bridge and Pinebush Road.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the ministry doing very much. We can&#8217;t wait forever and ever,&#8221; he said.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">&#8220;The problem is the ramp off the 401. People come off the ramp at one heck of a clip and they keep clipping all the way down Franklin.&#8221;<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Signs won&#8217;t do much to slow drivers, ministry officials said. But there are other things &#8212; like road markings or changing the feel of the roadway&#8221; &#8212; that might slow them on the ramp.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Dan Leake, the ministry&#8217;s senior project engineer overseeing the highway study, promised to carry the city&#8217;s safety concerns to the officials who oversee the ramp.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The city and Waterloo Region are conducting their own Franklin Boulevard pedestrian bridge study, after the death of a pedestrian in 2001 and a cyclist in October at the exit ramp.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The preferred alternative is some kind of widening of the bridge to create a sidewalk, or a standalone bridge there. Mayor Doug Craig worried the city was &#8220;working at cross purposes&#8221; with the new ministry highway study, since any redevelopment of the interchange is likely a decade way.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The Ministry knows about the city-region study, but the issue will be timing, said Jim Dowell, a traffic planner overseeing the study.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Public comment on the Highway 401 widening study is invited tonight at a drop-in session at the Knights of Columbus Hall, 333 Speedsville Rd., Cambridge. Another information session is set for Thursday at the Puslinch Community Centre, 29 Brock Rd. S., in Aberfoyle. Doors open for both events at 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.<\/font><br \/>    <br \/>   <font size=\"2\">Final highway recommendations will be up for public review in 2010.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">The ministry has already approved a plan to widen the 6-lane freeway to 10 lanes from Highway 8 to Hespeler Road. This study looks at improvements for another 26 kilometres west.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Traffic projections include the impact of proposed GO train service expansions to Kitchener and Cambridge over the next two decades, council was told.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">Coun. Ben Tucci wondered if the millions of dollars needed to widen the freeway would be better spend on expanding the province&#8217;s public transit services.<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">&#8220;In my view, the expansion of highways is past tense and we should be looking at moving pedestrians out of cars into rail, GO transit or high speed rail.&quot;<\/font><\/div> <br \/>   <div align=\"left\"><font size=\"2\">kswayze@therecord.com<\/font><\/div>","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

Also when corporations build their HQs in downtown cores there are often complaints about the increased traffic congestion, demand for parking, etc. along with calls for them to build out in the boonies. Why does RIM's HQ need to be in the core? <br \/>    <br \/>    Does anyone really believe that top RIM executives, many of whom live out in the suburbs, are going to walk, cycle or use public transit to get to work?<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> That's the point of the core, to be the place that's always busy. Looking for a small town feel at the center of a city of over half a million people is just plain silly. London, Ontario is smaller Waterloo Region, but based on downtowns you'd never guess that. Not that London is a perfect model, but you can have downtown offices in a city of our size.<br \/>    <br \/>    Also, given all the revitalization effort being put into downtown, and formerly uptown, I can't imagine people complaining about development bringing too much traffic. Downtown Kitchener currently doesn't have any notable traffic.<br \/>    <br \/>    The RIM execs are a very small portion of RIM's workforce.

There's a reason people talk about vibrant urban life, I've never heard of vibrant suburban life.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    Also, are suburbs really the best way to attract the kind of talent RIM wants? Google certainly doesn't think so. Google's Waterloo office specializes in mobile, they're competing directly with RIM. Where do they feel is a good place to be? Apparently downtown Kitchener is more attractive to them than right next to the university, that's why they're moving.<br \/>    <br \/>    Why doesn't more of UW's top CS and and engineering talent stay in Waterloo? The predominant opinion among students is that Waterloo is &quot;lame&quot;. It's just endless generic suburbia without that vibrant urban life.

The computer-aided dispatch (CAD\/AVL) system and automatic passenger counting (APC) systems have provided significant benefits relating to operational efficiency, service quality and customer service.<br \/>    <br \/>    In light of these benefits and the ability to implement automated stop announcements, staff is proposing the roll-out of the INIT advanced transit technology to the total bus fleet. As a next step, this report recommends the implementation of the CAD\/AVL system and APC system on 13 new 2009 NOVA buses and the AVL system on the 19 existing 2004 NOVA buses which are currently equipped with the APC system only.

A sign saying &#8220;Stop Here on Red Signal&#8221; will be installed.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We have been doing quite a bit of work with the City of Kitchener because our organization had some concerns about King Street,&#8221; Eric Gillespie, the head of Grand River Transit, said Friday.<br \/>    <br \/>    For several months King Street between Frederick and Gaukel was reconstructed. The roadway was narrowed, the sidewalks widened, decorative light standards installed and a lot of trees planted.<br \/>    <br \/>    The wider sidewalks make the roadway appear narrower than it really is and there was a concern that two buses heading in opposite directions would not be able to pass one another.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We have done some testing on that and it is all good,&#8221; Gillespie said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The tests were done last Tuesday.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It was a bit of an optical illusion. A number of our employees had concerns just looking at King Street that two buses would not be able to pass,&#8221; Gillespie said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Buses should be rolling over the reconstructed section of King Street some time this week.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Student demand leaves some passengers waiting for buses<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    December 01, 2009<br \/>    By Jeff Outhit, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO &#8212; Just about every day, overcrowded Grand River Transit buses leave dozens of waiting passengers stranded at bus stops.<br \/>    <br \/>    It happens regularly on up to seven routes near Waterloo campuses, where university students flash their student cards to board.<br \/>    <br \/>    University of Waterloo student Victoria Chan sees less crowding on public transit in her native Hong Kong. There, she can always get a seat on a double-decker bus.<br \/>    <br \/>    But here, she has to squeeze up against strollers and crowds of students. &#8220;You get stepped on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not cool.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It&#8217;s crowded and sometimes I get left behind,&#8221; said Sean Siva, also a UW student. &#8220;The driver says, &#8216;Sorry, you have to wait for the next bus.&#8217;&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    This makes him &#8220;kind of angry, because they should have more bus services.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Manav Kapoor, also a UW student, waited for a bus Monday that never showed up. He was trying to get from his off-campus home to class.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Sometimes the bus driver won&#8217;t even stop for you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He&#8217;ll just keep going and wave at you, and tell you that the bus supposedly can&#8217;t stop.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It&#8217;s very annoying, because I end up walking to school.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    All three students want more buses on their routes. But Grand River Transit doesn&#8217;t have enough drivers to meet soaring demand.<br \/>    <br \/>    Now, regional councillors are considering hiring two more drivers, to expand service starting in January. The added service, including new drivers, would cost taxpayers $250,000 as part of a proposed 2010 tax increase.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;If we want people to keep riding the buses, and encourage them to use them rather than driving, we need to make sure the bus service is good, and doesn&#8217;t leave people standing,&#8221; Regional Chair Ken Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Transit estimates 18 to 25 buses cram to capacity every day. It&#8217;s estimated this leaves 50 to 80 waiting passengers stranded at the curb.<br \/>    <br \/>    Chronic overcrowding highlights the success of a U-pass program that lets UW and Wilfrid Laurier University students board with their student cards.<br \/>    <br \/>    Students pay a fee of $50 per term, added to their tuition costs. It&#8217;s an 80-per-cent discount over monthly adult passes, negotiated by politicians to boost ridership.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Students appear to love it,&#8221; says Chris Neal, a vice-president with the UW student government.<br \/>    <br \/>    He hasn&#8217;t heard many complaints about overcrowding but says adding buses to campus-area routes makes sense.<br \/>    <br \/>    Campus-area routes were given extra buses when U-passes launched a few years ago. But growing demand continues to swamp them.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Buses struggle while politicians dream of trains<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    December 12, 2009 <br \/>    Road Ahead column by Jeff Outhit<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/643231\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/643231<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s good that Grand River Transit is drawing more university students. But the poor service they&#8217;re getting doesn&#8217;t inspire confidence in a small system that aspires to greatness.<br \/>    <br \/>    Students are lining up for buses to take advantage of a steep fare discount. They can flash student cards and ride for about 80 per cent less than the cost of a monthly adult pass. The small fee is added to their tuition costs.<br \/>    <br \/>    Politicians are targeting students in part because it builds ridership more easily than luring commuters from their cars. <br \/>    <br \/>    This may not help the environment much, because many students would be walking or cycling if they weren&#8217;t on a bus. But it could be argued that getting students onto transit increases the likelihood they will stick with transit after they become commuters. <br \/>    <br \/>    Except what they&#8217;re learning is that transit is a rough ride. <br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s estimated up to 80 passengers are stranded daily at the curb, by up to 25 overcrowded buses plying up to seven campus-area routes. Students are packed into the aisles or left behind. One student said it&#8217;s worse than Hong Kong, where she could always find a seat.<br \/>    <br \/>    Students are being taught that if you want to get around comfortably and reliably, buy a car and put your miserable public transit days behind you. <br \/>    <br \/>    To fix this, Grand River Transit needs to run more buses, more often. That&#8217;s how you build ridership. <br \/>    <br \/>    The transit service has already redeployed some buses from quieter routes, but the increase is not keeping pace with student demand. Council is now considering a $250,000 tax increase to add more buses to campus-area routes. <br \/>    <br \/>    This highlights a bigger issue, which is that politicians, reluctant to raise taxes, have stopped expanding transit. Service per resident has flatlined since 2006. Last year, it actually slipped a bit. <br \/>    <br \/>    Yet regional council continues to seek $800 million from senior governments, to install a flashy rapid transit system of electric trains and fast buses. <br \/>    <br \/>    Rapid transit is an ambitious scheme that politicians love. It has more to do with urban redevelopment than with moving people around. It&#8217;s exciting and sexy. <br \/>    <br \/>    Regular transit is boring, by comparison. And it&#8217;s struggling. Benchmarks show it&#8217;s still not a well-used service, despite a few overcrowded routes. And it consumes a heavier subsidy than in comparable cities. <br \/>    <br \/>    There&#8217;s grunt work to do, but politicians have stars in their eyes.","signature":"","date":"01-02-2010 07:06 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-02-2010 07:10 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"11"},"250":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4563"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Grand River transit riders will soon be able to Google their ride<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    December 31, 2009 <br \/>    By Terry Pender, Record staff<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/649756\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/649756<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO REGION \u2014 Some time next year Grand River Transit riders should be planning trips using an increasingly popular feature of the world\u2019s most-used search engine \u2014 Google Transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    But Waterloo Region hopes to add several layers of detail that many transit operators currently do not include in Google Transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    In addition to schedules and routes, the usual fare found at Google.com\/transit, the planners at the Region of Waterloo want to include streets, sidewalks, bike lanes and trails.<br \/>    <br \/>    John Hill, a planner with Waterloo Region, calls this multi-modal mapping.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cFrom our conversations with Google it seems like it is feasible that we could do something like this,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The idea is to let someone find the most convenient bus stop and what sidewalks or trails are nearby.

It will no longer provide employee parking at public expense. <br \/>    <br \/>    According to a city report, employees at Kitchener City Hall in the Kitchener core will now have to park on their own dime. If they need their car for work, they will be reimbursed a parking rate.<br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s estimated this will save taxpayers $300,000 spent each year to subsidize employee parking. &#8220;It&#8217;s good from an environmental standpoint,&#8221; Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Some city employees are now looking at carpooling or Grand River Transit, Zehr said. Others may choose to pay for their current parking space, or hunt for a cheaper one. <br \/>    <br \/>    Taxpayers continue to fully subsidize parking for employees of the cities of Waterloo, Cambridge, and Waterloo regional government. Governments need to end this subsidy so they can be seen to practise what they preach. <br \/>    <br \/>    Politicians talk a lot about getting residents out of their cars, to reduce emissions, ease road-building costs, improve fitness, and restrain suburban sprawl. Some steps are underway. <br \/>    <br \/>    For example, municipal planners are considering ways to reduce parking at new private developments. This is intended to nudge more people onto transit, sidewalks, bicycles or carpools. Yet while they ponder restrictions on private parking, councils pay for civil servants to park for free.<br \/>    <br \/>    Another example: Waterloo regional government proposes to spend $800 million to help put electric trains on local streets. This is meant to lure more downtown commuters onto transit. <br \/>    <br \/>    Yet regional council spends $398,000 a year to provide free parking for its employees. Most of this amount is spent to lease spaces in downtown Kitchener and Waterloo.

Biggest of all is the time (and thus operating costs) saved in loading, as that would be done quickly and through all doors.<br \/>   <br \/>   Just as a point of reference, total GRT expenditures last year were $73m, $21.5m of which came from passenger revenue and $41.5m of which came from regional taxes. So it would be a 50% increase in the regional tax levy to make transit free. (Though it would be somewhat more due to the higher resulting ridership.)<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> There's something wrong with your math. Passenger revenue + Regional subsidy is less than the expenditures. Also, a 1% Regional tax increase generates $3,500,000 in revenue. That gives me an 6.1% tax increase to make transit free, assuming the $21,500,000 in passenger revenue is correct. The Region has an annual budget of over $1,000,000,000, tax revenue is more than $43,000,000 (the revenue that would make a 50% tax increase generate $21,500,000). After accounting for the savings of not collecting fares you could probably get that increase down to 5%, but then you'd face the massive increase in demand for service. However, people might be more willing to pay the tax increase when they get the direct benefits as transit users.<br \/>    <br \/>   <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20100530005214im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>garthdanlor<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20100530005214\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=6283#post6283\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20100530005214im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">I suppose you might be able to gain some (or even considerable) popular support for &quot;free&quot; transit if you offered it as an alternative to LRT.

Not sure that Ottawa is the best comparison either (is there one?) as they simply aren't offering free bus service, plus have more way more tourist and government traffic.    Anyway, the hope in such a scenario would be that that you entice enough people away from private vehicles that you wouldn't have a net increase in traffic.  Would, it work?  Who knows, possibly.  Will it happen?  Absolutely not.  Frankly I have growing fears over LRT too.  I can sense some Harris style &quot;Common Sense&quot; coming with the next (Tory?) provincial government that will derail our LRT dreams for a generation.

I hear people complaining that transit &quot;requires government handouts&quot;, then they go hop in their car and drive on publicly funded roads. Transit may have a 40% cost recovery rate, but roads have a 0% cost recovery rate. To makes costs truly apparent to people we would need to either toll roads and making people pay for parking, or provide transit for free. Either fair case causes a massive shift to public transit, which is strong evidence that our current road subsidy system causes our car culture.<br \/>   <br \/>   The 407 is a prime example of a stupid government decision. It was built with taxpayer money, then sold at a horrible return to a private consortium. It wasn't even the best option of the offers presented to the Ontario government.

By October, 161 buses (74 per cent of the fleet) will have this technology, already in use on express routes. All buses are planned to have it by 2014 as older buses are replaced.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional council hopes this will fend off a potential prosecution by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. The commission says announcing stops is an immediate need and it\u2019s not good enough for drivers to call stops on request, as they do now. This follows a landmark ruling won by a blind Toronto passenger in 2007.<br \/>    <br \/>    Annual staffing costs for the new technology will eventually reach $260,000. It would have been much cheaper to have drivers call out all bus stops. But drivers refused, forcing a health and safety review that has yet to conclude. Automated announcements are now seen as the best resolution.<br \/>    <br \/>    It\u2019s expensive but seems the best way forward for three reasons.<br \/>    <br \/>    1. There\u2019s little to be gained in opposing a human rights demand that originated elsewhere but is not unreasonable.<br \/>    <br \/>    2. While some drivers can surely call out stops, it\u2019s impractical to require all drivers to call out all stops, all the time. Too often drivers are busy with traffic, bad weather, and noise. They don\u2019t need another distraction.<br \/>    <br \/>    3. New technology will improve transit for all passengers in many ways.<br \/>    <br \/>    Satellite tracking of all buses is required to automate announcements. Knowing where all buses are at all times helps keep buses on schedule. The technology can be further developed to tell passengers when their bus will arrive, in real time. It can help plan better bus routes, minimize delays, and speed responses when buses break down.<br \/>    <br \/>    This is all good. But realistically, better technology will not likely draw many more passengers from their cars.<br \/>    <br \/>    This shift will happen when Grand River Transit is seen as a competitive way to travel. To achieve this, politicians will have to buy a lot more buses and run them a lot more often to a lot more places. At the same time, traffic congestion will have to get so bad that people will no longer want to drive if they can avoid it.<br \/>    <br \/>    Honestly, we\u2019re decades away from anything that.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> &quot;Spending $2.5 million to improve service for blind and deaf passengers&quot; ignores the fact that on crowded buses it's difficult for anyone to know where they are because they can't see out.

Wouldn't you rather have the Record writing editorials that plead your case rather than writing ones that (ought to) embarrass you?<br \/>   <br \/>   As for the rest, I'll let the Record's editorial writers respond. They speak more eloquently than I: <a href=\"\/web\/20100530005705\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/516526\" target=\"_blank\">Driving a bus? Turn off your cellphone<\/a><div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tAt the start of this year, Grand River Transit bus drivers flatly refused an order to call out every route stop as a way of helping blind passengers who might be aboard.<br \/>   <br \/>   While the drivers weren't adverse to assisting people, they complained that calling out all the stops all the time would overstress and distract them, putting their health and passenger safety at risk. The drivers were right and this newspaper, as well as many people in the community, fully agreed with them.<br \/>   <br \/>   Today, however, we would ask the drivers to do something else in the interests of their own health and passenger safety: Turn off your cellphones when you're behind the wheel of your bus. Please.<br \/>   <br \/>   It shouldn't be necessary to say this. Since 2006, Grand River Transit has had an official policy that forbids drivers from talking on cellphones while driving. Meanwhile, the Ontario government is passing legislation to make it illegal to use a cellphone while holding it and driving any vehicle on a roadway.<br \/>   <br \/>   Despite this and the common sense arguments against gabbing on a cellphone while navigating a large vehicle filled with dozens of people through rush-hour clogged streets, a few drivers, at least, can't resist doing it. One regular passenger, Christine McDougall, says she watched the driver of a bus she was riding in last week yak on a cellphone for 20 minutes, often with just one hand on the wheel. So strong were her concerns about the incident that she lodged an official complaint with Grand River Transit.<br \/>   <br \/>   This may not be an isolated incident. Since The Record ran McDougall's story yesterday, <b>many regular transit riders have contacted the newspaper with their own reports of harrowing trips with drivers engaged in cellphone conversations<\/b>. The transit authority needs to hear what the public is saying and act.<br \/>   <br \/>   To be sure, Grand River Transit and its workers run a fine, much needed service that is subject to many demands and pressures. In all likelihood, it's only a very small minority of drivers who use their cellphones while working. And of those who do, many probably use their cellphones for brief, urgent messages.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>But having argued that they're too involved with their work to call out every bus stop, the drivers should, every man and woman among them, accept that they're too busy when they drive to talk on the phone.<\/b> Passengers simply don't feel safe in such a situation.<br \/>   <br \/>   And if the drivers can't accept this fact, perhaps they should simply see the wisdom of obeying the official policy of their employer when being watched by so many people with their own cellphones and the inclination to use them to complain.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> As for driving while yakking, there's here's a small selection of reports in the Record:<br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20100530005705\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/516064\" target=\"_blank\">Unsafe at any speed dial<\/a><div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tChristine McDougall was dismayed to watch her <b>bus driver yak on his cellphone for 20 minutes, one hand on the wheel<\/b>.<br \/>   <br \/>   &quot;I'm thinking 'Oh my goodness, this is not safe,' &quot; she says.<br \/>   <br \/>   When she called a customer service line to complain, an employee tried to brush her off, <b>telling her there's no policy against drivers talking on phones<\/b>. &quot;She was very dismissive of me,&quot; McDougall says.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> <a href=\"\/web\/20100530005705\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/520109\" target=\"_blank\">Drivers using phones<\/a><div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tRegarding the complaint about a Grand River Transit driver who continually talked on his cellphone while driving, <b>I am a school bus driver in Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge and I see it almost every day<\/b>.<br \/>   <br \/>   I was at the stop light at Victoria Street and Hazelglen Drive in Kitchener, waiting for the light to change, while a GRT bus was turning off Victoria onto Hazelglen.

If it's such a serious issue why has your union kept silent about it, at least from the public's perspective? Considering the concern over cellphone use I'd imagine you could garner a lot of sympathy with the public if only we knew about it.<br \/>    <br \/>    If it's only a small minority of drivers then why aren't the rest of you using peer pressure to stop this dangerous practice?  After all you pass these guys on your routes every day and you're as much at risk from their dangerous  behaviour as anyone. And again why isn't this getting more publicity -- both the yakking on whatever device and the call sheets that you can't read? It seems to me that your union is consistently letting you down. Wouldn't you rather have the Record writing editorials that plead your case rather than writing ones that (ought to) embarrass you?<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> The media in Waterloo Region seems to be incredably one-sided when it comes to issues such as these.  Don't think our union hasn't approached the media regarding the bus stop calling and other issues, we do discuss these thing at our union meetings, but it seems whenever the union goes to the media with something all of a sudden Management is breathing down the neck of people to stop it.  I've been told at at least one union meeting that in the past, when it was still Kitchener Transit, the union took out a whole page advertisment in The Record to make some point or another (it was before my time, so I don't know what it was about) and what did The Record do? they actually went to the City of Kitchener and told them the union was doing this and the municipality told the paper not to print it; like what the heck?! This is the kind of one-sidedness I'm talking about.<br \/>    <br \/>    Our union has also approached the media about publishing\/airing stories about drivers being assulted by passengers and teaming up with CrimeStoppers to help stop it, and trying to get good new stories aired like when drivers help citizens in need.  But the media isn't interested unless it's given the okay by The Region, and we cannot get The Region to co-operate...so we as the union run around in circles like chickens with our head cut off while on one side the media attacks us and won't support us, on another the Region doesn't defend us, on another we are getting assulted and harrassed by certain passengers on a daily basis and on another we got some of our own drivers being stupid and ruining what shread of image we do have.<br \/>    <br \/>    In terms of the union, they give explicit &quot;orders&quot; to drivers to stop being stupid and stop talking on their phones, stop belittling the public on the radio etc. etc., but just like other motorists out there, there are those who don't seem to think the rules apply to them, and those are the one the public is seeing.<br \/>    <br \/>    In terms of using peer pressure to stop people from using cell phone there is this stigma that it's not a good idea to &quot;rat out&quot; your co-workers, if you say something to them they tell others who look down upon you, if you say it over the radio everyone can here it, if you tell management you are a rat and management see the union members fighting amonst ourselves (and probably love it I might add).  No, this is not the union letting us down, this is (I will admit) drivers being their own worst enemy; the public then takes this minority as the norm for all drivers, blows it way out of proportion and all of a sudden it's considered to be the norm.","signature":"","date":"05-17-2010 12:17 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"05-17-2010 12:26 AM","user":"GGHTransit"},"num_in_thread":"124"},"6912":{"user":{"name":"IEFBR14","avatar":null,"title":"Senior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation H2OWC    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 321","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20100530005705im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>GGHTransit<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20100530005705\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=6911#post6911\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20100530005705im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">The media in Waterloo Region seems to be incredably one-sided when it comes to issues such as these.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> If you go back through the Record's online archives as I did above, you'll find letters from union members offering views that conflict with the Record's editorial policy on bus driver cellphone use and stop calling.

GRT employs 490 members of CAW Local 4304. In 2007 GRT conventional transit ridership was 14,400,000 and our specialized transit service, MobilityPLUS provides almost 500 trips daily to approximately 250 customers.

Overall though, \"[it] has gone very well,\" he said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Transit had not anticipated the noon-hour bus rush, an instant headache to anyone who has experienced it. GRT discovered early on that as a result of the increase in demand, an extra peak time developed. \"It hadn&#8217;t been expected,\" said Beniston. Modifications to the original changes in service were made as a result. <br \/>    <br \/>    As of January, additional Route 12 busses have formally been added to the changes implemented at the beginning of the fall term. Prior to January, GRT had simply been slotting in extra busses to meet demand as it arose. <br \/>    <br \/>    And to those temporarily left out of the U-Pass as it stands, change is on its way. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"Without question, by the summer 2008 term, co-op and regular students will be able to opt-in to the U-Pass program when working in Waterloo region,\" said Royal. \"I commend a number of directors, especially director Aho (engineering) and director Neal (St. Jerome&#8217;s) for supporting me in making that part of negotiations a dealbreaker.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    In regard to the proposed swipe card system, originally positioned as a potential replacement to the simple but vulnerable flashing of the WatCard as a means of entry, an upgrade is still in the works. \"At this point, it&#8217;s still uncertain whether we will continue the current procedure, implement a swipe card system, or implement other possibilities,\" said Royal. <br \/>    <br \/>    While happy to have the U-Pass, some new student users are finding it difficult to navigate through route maps and timetables. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"It&#8217;s confusing to figure out the schedule,\" said Serge Koloupaev, a math and actuarial science student, \"but the buses aren&#8217;t too busy or crowded on my routes.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    Maps of GRT bus routes are available for free in the Student Life Centre on the wall across from the CIBC bank machine near the turnkey desk. Additional bus and route info is available online at <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.grt.ca<\/a>. <br \/>    <br \/>    For students still at a loss to effectively navigate the available route maps and schedules, expect a GRT interactive trip planner to be available online soon. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"The system is currently in testing,\" said Beniston, \"but will be rolling out this winter.\" Expect it to be similar to the system used by the City of Brampton. <br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Transit is holding three feedback sessions in January to discuss proposed changes, new rural services, and plans to create a region-wide specialized service.

This program builds on the previous success of a similar program with Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU), which was initiated in September 2005. UPass programs allow qualifying students unlimited use of Grand River Transit (GRT) service for a fee charged per-term as part of their tuition.<br \/>    <br \/>    Eligible students have the U-Pass fee (currently $41.08 per term) added to their tuition statement. At both universities, eligible students include all full-time registered on-campus undergraduates. Part-time students, students attending satellite campuses outside the Region (WLU Brantford, for example), and students on co-op work terms are not currently eligible. Full-time graduate students at WLU have been included in the program since September 2007.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>U-Pass Ridership<\/b><br \/>    In 2007 GRT provided over 1.4 Million rides to U-Pass holders. This represents approximately 7% of GRT&#8217;s 19.1 Million 2007 boardings (revenue passengers totalleded 14.4 Million). Approximately 60% of GRT ridership growth in 2007 can be attributed to the U-Pass programs.","signature":"","date":"01-02-2010 04:45 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-02-2010 04:58 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"4"},"243":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4563"}},"content":"<b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Province chips in for region's new buses<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    RECORD STAFF<br \/>    WATERLOO REGION<br \/>    <br \/>    Plans by Waterloo Region to increase its bus fleet by 10 could now be covered by the province.<br \/>    <br \/>    Yesterday, the region received $5.3 million from the Ontario government to improve public transit services.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"This will help us pay for those buses and potentially free up money for other transit acquisitions,\" said Mike Murray, regional chief administrative officer.<br \/>    <br \/>    This one-time grant of $5.3 million is the local allocation of the $500 million the province announced for public transit in December.<br \/>    <br \/>    The money can be spent to buy buses, shelters, security equipment or fare-collection systems,<br \/>    <br \/>    Murray said the region plans to buy 10 additional buses in 2009, of which six will be hybrids.<br \/>    <br \/>    Another 11 replacement buses will be bought.<br \/>    <br \/>    A conventional bus costs about $400,000, while a hybrid bus costs $500,000, bringing the total cost for the 10 new buses to $4.6 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    The region's capital budget for Grand River Transit is $12.8 million this year and $10.6 million in 2009, and this announcement means regional taxpayers will be paying less of that bill.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Announcements like this really help,\" Murray said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Since the region assumed control of Grand River Transit in 2000, both ridership and hours of service have increased by 50 per cent.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">2008 Transit Service Improvement Plan<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    DATE: March 4, 2008<br \/>    Report: http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/WEB\/Region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/E35DE6918C8EDEC0852573FE00570710\/$file\/P-08-029.pdf<br \/>    Draft Brochure for 2008 Consultation Centres (Waterloo Version) -

Highlights include:<br \/>    <br \/>    A website where you can plan your trip from door to door, showing times, distances and transfers.<br \/>    <br \/>    A telephone number to provide you with departure times at your stop.<br \/>    <br \/>    Text messaging, to reveal the next three times the bus is scheduled at your stop.<br \/>    <br \/>    Governments are spending $3 million on consumer-friendly technology to promote transit. Other elements, already in place, include flat-panel information displays at terminals, real-time displays on express buses, and green-light priority for express buses at 17 intersections. These are all welcome initiatives, detailed at <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.grt.ca<\/a>. They will make public transit a better experience.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The goal really is to get people out of their cars, and change their habits,\" Kitchener Centre MPP John Milloy said.<br \/>    <br \/>    It's a laudable goal. Unfortunately, what EasyGo shows me is why I still drive my car.<br \/>    <br \/>    Let's say I want to commute by bus, leaving home at 8 a.m. and returning after 5 p.m. I asked the online trip planner: What's the fastest way to get from my front door to The Record and back again?<br \/>    <br \/>    As promised, the planner told me where to walk, where to catch the bus, and what buses to take. A helpful map was provided. But the result was disheartening. My daily commute by Grand River Transit would require a transfer each way at Fairview Park mall and consume 91 minutes. This includes:<br \/>    <br \/>    24 minutes of walking to bus stops.<br \/>    <br \/>    15 minutes of waiting for buses.<br \/>    <br \/>    52 minutes on buses.<br \/>    <br \/>    The online planner missed the closest bus stop to my house, making me walk a bit longer than necessary. But here's the bigger concern.<br \/>    <br \/>    I live seven kilometres from work. I can drive there and back in 24 minutes. So my commuting options are 24 pleasant minutes by car or 91 minutes on transit, outside in bad weather, mingling with strangers.<br \/>    <br \/>    It's a no-brainer.<br \/>    <br \/>    Taking transit would consume an extra 67 minutes of my day. I have other things to do with that time. I can actually walk to work and back in two hours, which is not much slower than taking the bus.<br \/>    <br \/>    So yes, soaring gas prices hurt, and driving is bad for the environment. But EasyGo reminds me that public transit is achingly slow. In my case, it's almost four times slower.<br \/>    <br \/>    Until that changes, I'll be in my car.","signature":"","date":"01-02-2010 06:05 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-02-2010 06:10 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"7"},"246":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4563"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">TRANSIT NETWORK REDESIGN AND OPERATIONAL DATA ANALYSIS<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    June 10, 2008<br \/>    http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/79264A7514DFA7EE85257460004C2660\/$file\/P-08-065.pdf<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>RECOMMENDATION:<\/b><br \/>    THAT the Regional Municipality of Waterloo approve a study to redesign the conventional bus network to support Rapid Transit including the development of an operational data management system, to be undertaken in collaboration with the University of Waterloo at a cost of $197,940, as described in P-08-065, dated June 10, 2008.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/646992a6b2d4dea085256e590071a3e9\/4575ea8ea10c8edf852574b300541617\/Body\/0.EC!OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GRT unveils new hybrid technology bus<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    August 28, 2008<br \/>    http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/$All\/4575EA8EA10C8EDF852574B300541617?OpenDocument<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener &#8211; Grand River Transit (GRT) unveiled the first of six environmentally friendly hybrid buses Thursday evening.<br \/>    <br \/>    These buses will be used in a pilot program for low-speed, high-stop bus routes where they are expected to have the greatest impact, both economically and environmentally. Five buses will be used on routes that serve Kitchener and Waterloo and one bus will operate in Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The hybrid bus pilot is one more step towards a more sustainable community,\" said Ken Seiling, Regional Chair. \"Using less fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is part of our ongoing commitment to better environmental practices here in the region.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Although these buses initially cost more than conventional diesel models, they are expected to use less fuel, have reduced emissions and lower operating costs. In the right environment, they can reduce fuel use by up to 30 per cent. With six buses, this could lead to a savings of 50,000 litres of fuel every year as well as a 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The unique hybrid-electric system will also result in lower operating costs due to reduced stress and maintenance on mechanical components.<br \/>    <br \/>    A hybrid-electric vehicle uses two power sources: a combustion engine and a battery. The two sources work together to produce energy. The battery powers the vehicle during acceleration and when moving at lower speeds. As the vehicle reaches 40 km\/hr, the mechanical power provided by the engine continues to increase while the electric power gradually decreases. The engine takes over, powering the vehicle at high speeds when it is most efficient. The battery can also collect energy from the rolling vehicle as it is braking and convert it into electricity. It uses this electricity to recharge itself, instead of relying on the engine.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I applaud the initiative taken by Regional Council on improving the efficiency of our transit fleet and reducing the carbon footprint of GRT,&#8221; said Jake Smola, Regional Councillor and Chair of the Environmental Advisory Committee.<br \/>    <br \/>    For more information on Region of Waterloo green initiatives, visit <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/sustainability\" target=\"_blank\">www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/sustainability<\/a>.<br \/>    <br \/>    -30-<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">HIGHWAY 8, FAIRWAY ROAD TO SPORTSWORLD DRIVE, BUS-BYPASS SHOULDERS<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    September 30, 2008<br \/>    http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/250DA3BE6C9E07D4852574D00059372C\/$file\/P-08-075.pdf<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>RECOMMENDATION:<\/b><br \/>    THAT the Regional Municipality of Waterloo enter into an agreement with Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario (by its Ministry of Transportation) to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Planning, Housing and Community Services and the Regional Solicitor to provide capital funding for bus bypass shoulders on Highway 8 between Fairway Road and Sportsworld Drive, as described in P-08-075, dated September 30, 2008.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Bypass shoulders will help speed buses<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    October 11, 2008 <br \/>    JEFF OUTHIT, RECORD STAFF<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/427989\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/427989<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    More people would ride transit if buses could avoid traffic jams. Making this happen is expensive.<br \/>    <br \/>    Consider the latest transit plans for Highway 8 between Kitchener and Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Traffic is often stop-and-go. Grand River Transit buses regularly detour to local roads to avoid highway congestion. It doesn't help much. Heavy traffic often delays intercity express service by up to 10 minutes.<br \/>    <br \/>    This bothers passengers and means more buses are needed to maintain schedules.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional council has now found a solution. When Highway 8 is widened for almost four kilometres between Fairway Road and Sportsworld Drive, road shoulders will be supersized, so buses can use them to bypass traffic jams.<br \/>    <br \/>    Shoulders normally three metres wide will be extended to 4.25 metres. Pavement will be thickened to support bus weight. This will cost $4.3 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    Costs are high because two bridges -- over the Grand River and King Street East -- need widening. Still, it's considered a bargain. It would cost $9.1 million if not co-ordinated with the provincial highway widening that starts next year.<br \/>    <br \/>    Bypass shoulders are not regular driving lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    Buses will be allowed on them only when traffic falls below 60 kilometres an hour. Bus speeds on the shoulders are limited to 20 km\/h above traffic speeds.<br \/>    <br \/>    Widening the shoulders brings flexibility to traffic planning.<br \/>    <br \/>    If bus rapid transit is launched between Kitchener and Cambridge, bypass shoulders would be available to keep those buses moving. Also, their presence makes it easier to convert regular lanes to high-occupancy lanes at some future date.<br \/>    <br \/>    These lanes, for buses and cars with passengers, would go near the median. Shoulders would shrink to regular size. Their extra width would be used to buffer the high-occupancy lanes from regular lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    You might ask, why not add a full, dedicated bus lane rather than a shoulder with restricted access?<br \/>    <br \/>    This has not been costed but would be far more expensive. It would require widening the highway by 3.75 metres rather than 1.25 metres. And it likely would not be necessary.<br \/>    <br \/>    By 2011, Highway 8 will have eight driving lanes between Fairway Road and the King Street overpass, and six lanes between the overpass and Sportsworld Drive. This is expected to ease congestion for 15 years or more.<br \/>    <br \/>    Supersizing the shoulder at the same time is a flexible way to support transit and traffic options without breaking the bank.","signature":"","date":"01-02-2010 06:12 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-02-2010 06:39 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"8"},"247":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4563"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Public Consultation Centre<\/font><\/font><\/b> - http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/web\/transit.nsf\/$All\/AF5301AD645E4D8C8525736100524862?OpenDocument<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/web\/transit.nsf\/8cc429bdafbb761e85256e5a005c53f5\/af5301ad645e4d8c8525736100524862\/Body\/0.84!OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    Maps: http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/web\/transit.nsf\/$All\/AF5301AD645E4D8C8525736100524862\/$file\/Elmira%202008%20map.pdf?openelement<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">New Year could bring bus fare hike<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    November 18, 2008<br \/>    Jeff Outhit, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Transit wants to hike transit fares on Jan. 1.<br \/>    <br \/>    If approved, it would be the fourth fare increase since 2004.<br \/>    <br \/>    Highlights:<br \/>    <br \/>    All monthly passes would rise $2.

They&#8217;ll be monitoring numbers over the summer to see if ridership picks up as more people incorporate the bus into their travel plans.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried to get the awareness out there, but maybe not everyone knows or knows how they can use it for their travel,&#8221; Malcom said. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll be seeing ridership improve over time.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Bus service shuffled to combat overcrowding<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    June 03, 2009 <br \/>    By Jeff Outhit, Record staff<br \/>    Web edition<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/BreakingNews\/article\/547167\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Break...article\/547167<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20120220064159im_\/http:\/\/media.therecord.topscms.com\/images\/8e\/30\/7897fcbb4906a178fbf0302c8bf5.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    A row of buses waited along Weber Street North in Waterloo to take students home from St. David Catholic Secondary School on Tuesday. <br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO REGION &#8212; Grand River Transit will add buses to overcrowded routes while trimming buses from little-used routes.<br \/>    <br \/>    The shuffle approved yesterday by regional councillors will create winners and losers, without boosting transit costs. <br \/>    <br \/>    Winners will include passengers crammed onto express buses or left stranded by full buses. <br \/>    <br \/>    This happened often between last November and February, due partly to soaring student demand. &#8220;We just had to leave people behind,&#8221; transit director Eric Gillespie said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Losers will include 106 passengers who will lose some of the daily service they now get. &#8220;I think rationalizing the service, and realigning it to where the demand is, makes good business sense,&#8221; Gillespie said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Among the impacts:<br \/>    <br \/>    - Buses will be added on the Route 7 Mainline, the Route 9 Lakeshore, the Route 12 Conestoga Mall, and the intercity express service.<br \/>    <br \/>    - Buses will be removed from 22 other routes in various ways. For some routes, buses will run less often at certain times. Other routes will see some trips shortened. <br \/>    <br \/>    In total, councillors intend to transfer 4,000 hours of annual service from quiet routes to busy ones.<br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s estimated this could help transit add 218 passengers per day, overshadowing the impact to disadvantaged passengers. <br \/>    <br \/>    Changes take effect Sept. 8.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Proposed Service Changes for September, 2009<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/web\/transit.nsf\/$All\/5730F59FAF039C4D852575A20061AA8C?OpenDocument<br \/>    Proposed Service Changes <br \/>    Effective September 7, 2009 <br \/>    Pending Regional Council Approval<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed service changes for September, will be included in a report to the Regional Planning &amp; Works Committee on June 2, 2009.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>iXPRESS<\/b> Add an extra trip on weekday mornings between Fairview Park Mall and the University of Waterloo in response to increasing passenger demand, and increase the frequency between Conestoga Mall and Fairview Mall on Saturdays to every 15 minutes from the current 30 to address passenger demand and improve schedule reliability<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">PROPOSED 2009 TRANSIT SERVICE CHANGES<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    June 2, 2009<br \/>    http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/F9E1FB94C3DFA5D6852575C5004DE58F\/$file\/P-09-051.pdf?openelement<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>SUMMARY:<\/b><br \/>    This report outlines proposed service improvements to Routes 7, 9, 12 and iXpress amounting to approximately 4,000 annual service hours (Appendix 1) to address overcrowding and schedule adherence issues. Regional staff have reviewed how these hours may be provided within existing resource levels. In order to fund the proposed service improvements, a range of service reductions are proposed including elimination of trips, reduced service frequency and route restructuring (Appendices 2 to 4).<br \/>    <br \/>    A customer outreach program to inform GRT customers of the proposed reductions was initiated during the week of April 27, 2009. The program included signs on buses and at terminals, details on <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064159\/http:\/\/www.grt.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.grt.ca<\/a> and notices via the customer email subscriber list. In response, 27 GRT customers have provided feedback, summarized in Appendix 5. Customers expressed disappointment at proposed service reductions. Customers also expressed support for proposed additional service on key GRT routes and provided suggestions for additional service improvements which will be considered in the development of future service improvement plans.<br \/>    <br \/>    If approved, these service changes would be implemented Tuesday September 8, 2009.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>REPORT:<\/b><br \/>    <b><font color=\"red\">In 2008, GRT ridership grew by 9.9% from 14.4 million to 15.8 million.<\/font><\/b> This ridership growth followed a 7% increase in service hours in 2008.

Kelly Galloway said in an interview after the meeting. &#8220;There&#8217;s certain things that we have to stand up and fight against. It doesn&#8217;t always come down to the ultimate buck. It&#8217;s got to come down to what&#8217;s best for our community. &#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   The vacant lot, located on the southwest corner of Strasburg and Huron roads, is owned by Hallman Construction Inc. and is currently zoned for a business park. <br \/>   <br \/>   That zoning dates back to the 1980s and already allows for manufacturing and service stations. It doesn&#8217;t allow for the kind of diversified commercial use the developer wants. <br \/>   <br \/>   On Monday night, the development and technical services committee approved the change to a neighbourhood shopping centre zone for the southwest corner site and one also owned by Hallman on the opposite side of Huron Road. The change will allow for the building of a grocery store and the gas bar, among other amenities. <br \/>   <br \/>   Unlike a gas station, a gas bar does not offer maintenance services and is therefore seen as less environmentally risky. <br \/>   <br \/>   The area where the gas bar is being proposed is adjacent to Strasburg Creek and its flood plain. It falls within a Wellhead Protection Area. <br \/>   <br \/>   Several residents voiced their opposition to the inclusion of the gas bar at the meeting and presented a petition with 90 signatures. <br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We were so ignorant in the past with tossing horrid, poisonous things in the ground and in the lakes and waterways,&#8221; resident Ginny Quinn told the committee. &#8220;We cannot use ignorance as an excuse anymore. Every one of us must take extreme precautions at all times.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Even though current zoning would have allowed for a gas station, Galloway said it was out of date and the city should have taken a stand to prohibit any new development that posed a risk to the ground water and nearby wetlands. <br \/>   <br \/>   She pointed out that the Region&#8217;s new official plan, which has yet to get provincial approval, would not have allowed for a gas station because it&#8217;s located in a Source Water Protection Area. <br \/>   <br \/>   Regional staff initially opposed the land use, but eventually said they would support it as long as there were no vehicle maintenance facilities on the site. The Grand River Conservation Authority did not oppose the zone change because no development was proposed on the flood plain or the wetland. <br \/>   <br \/>   All councillors voted in favour of the zone change, but Galloway unsuccessfully motioned to have the gas bar removed from the permitted land use. <br \/>   <br \/>   Mayor Carl Zehr and Coun. Berry Vrbanovic pointed out that the issue could end up before the Ontario Municipal Board if they were to oppose the gas bar, which would cost the city money and likely result in the same decision. <br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;If the zoning was not there today for this property, I would not be supporting this aspect of the zone change,&#8221; Vrbanovic said. &#8220;This is clearly one of those instances where there isn&#8217;t a very obvious black and white answer when you consider all the facts and, when I do consider all of them, I think the gas bar is probably the best scenario we can get at this point in time.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Zehr added that there will be mitigation measures in place to reduce the risk of environmental damage and the city has to trust that those measures will be effective. <br \/>   <br \/>   A representative for the developer told the committee that there are strict regulations on both infrastructure and monitoring at the provincial and municipal level that ensure the risk of any spill is minimized and damage can be addressed quickly. <br \/>   <br \/>   That includes concrete pads and containment, stormwater management plans and building the gas reservoir tank above the water table. <br \/>   <br \/>   Galloway said, regardless of the mitigation measures in place, the city shouldn&#8217;t be endorsing anything that has the potential to damage the water system. <br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Sure there are mitigation efforts that will be taken into account and that&#8217;s great, if you&#8217;re willing to take that risk,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re talking about a water protection area and a wellhead protection area and any risk that is associated with this should just not be there.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   The zone change will come back to council for final approval on Monday.","signature":"","date":"09-14-2010 08:16 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"42"},"14498":{"user":{"name":"neonjoe","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, ON","member_since":"Feb 2010","num_posts":"65"}},"content":"Small one,<br \/>    McDonalds on Highland Rd.

The complex would include a dining room, activity room and access to 24-hour personal care.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 2005, the Ontario Ministry of Housing pledged $1 million toward the capital cost of building the complex.<br \/>    <br \/>    But it has been on hold since November 2005 because the Ontario Ministry of Health has not provided the estimated $500,000 annual cost to pay for the cost of supportive services.<br \/>    <br \/>    This type of housing would delay or prevent seniors from going to long-term care homes. The annual cost to house 30 seniors at a long-term facility would be about $1.5 million, one third of the operating cost for this project.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It is substantially cheaper to have a person in supportive housing rather than moving them into a long-term care facility -- notwithstanding the point that we have no beds,&quot; Carlin said.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are 400 people on a long-term care waiting list, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Earlier this year, Closson, who was hired by the province to investigate local emergency services, said the region needs 450 subsidized housing units for seniors to help them stay out of nursing homes and hospitals.<br \/>    <br \/>    This 30-unit project &quot;is only a very small start with respect to the need for supportive housing for seniors in Waterloo Region,&quot; said Carlin.<br \/>    <br \/>    In March, Ontario Health Minister George Smitherman told The Record he's started to work on Closson's recommendation for subsidized supportive housing for seniors in the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    Last Friday, Smitherman spokesperson David Spencer said the ministry is still working on finding the operating funds for this project.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We appreciate the urgency and the feelings that exist to move forward with this project.

Hospital staff, donors and guests gathered at Freeport today to officially celebrate the start of construction on the expansion. Dignitaries unveiled a ceremonial tree to be planted at the site to mark the growth of the new service. <br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Hospital was privileged to be joined by Michael Howlett, president and CEO of the Mental Health Commission of Canada. Mr. Howlett spoke about the key areas Canada needs to address in order to integrate and increase access to mental health care. He called the Grand River Hospital expansion a leading move in the right direction. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"It's my wish that this is one of many such celebrations, and that expanding mental health services becomes the rule in Canada, not the exception,\" Mr. Howlett said. <br \/>    <br \/>    The project will provide 50 new beds and programs for mental health patients in the region. It will allow patients who now travel to London to remain closer to home for specialized care. It will serve patients 16 years of age and older who may need stays of up to three months as they receive treatment for a mental illness. Patients who receive treatment at the K-W Site's acute mental health unit typically stay for a much shorter period of a week or two. <br \/>    <br \/>    Specific aspects of the expansion include:<ul><li>A new 10 bed psycho-geriatrics assessment unit for elderly patients with a mental illness;<\/li>   <li>A new 33 bed unit for patients with a severe and persistent mental illness, as well as a seven bed transition unit; and<\/li>   <li>The development of mental health outpatient and outreach services on the site.<\/li>   <\/ul>The new program will have flexibility to use beds for a range of mental health services, depending on the specific needs of the patient population. <br \/>    <br \/>    New day programs to run at Freeport will help mental health patients who have received in-patient treatment and continue to need support as they live in their own homes in the community. This includes programs to help patients with personal, vocational, social, residential and educational skills along with services to improve their quality of life. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"The expansion of the Freeport Site to accommodate this new program and the enhancement of mental health services at the K-W Site will be welcome improvements for patients, families and health providers,\" said Kris Bailey, chair of the GRH Board. \"I'm confident these improvements will enhance the care options available for patients and families, supported by a range of community mental health providers throughout the continuum of care.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    The Government of Ontario had provided $11.9 million in construction funding for the expansion and renovation. Grand River Hospital was pleased when the Honourable John Milloy announced additional funding for the project at today&#8217;s event, bringing the government&#8217;s total contribution to $13.5 million. <br \/>    <br \/>    Community donations raised through the Grand River Hospital Foundation will provide further funding to equip and furnish the new area for patients and families. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"Construction of the new mental health program at Freeport is a giant leap forward in increasing access to mental health services in our community,\" said Minister Milloy, the MPP for Kitchener Centre. \"It is vital that we continue to work together as a community to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and ensure individuals with a mental illness have access to the programs and support they need.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    The expansion will add over 9,000 square feet to the Freeport building. Two floors of the Grand River Terrace wing will have renovations to accommodate the new programs and services. The renovations are scheduled to take about two years to complete. <br \/>    <br \/>    \"The specialized mental health project at Freeport will be a tremendous addition to the range of mental health services available locally,\" said Dr. John Heintzman, Grand River Hospital&#8217;s chief of psychiatry. \"The level of support I&#8217;ve seen from health professionals and community providers for this new program has been outstanding.

The college is to receive federal and provincial funding totalling $72 million through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program and Ontario\u2019s 2009 Budget.<br \/>    ...<br \/>    The project also includes a 12,000 square-foot stand-alone facility at the Waterloo campus for the Conestoga\/OIRCA Roofing Skills Training Centre and a 10,000-square-foot addition to the main campus building for the HVAC Skills Training Centre. Some funding will be used for an expansion and renovation to support motive power skills training at the Guelph campus. When complete, the entire project will create an additional 2,350 student spaces and 800 new spaces for apprentices.<br \/>    <br \/>    Conestoga College is partnering with the Alliance of Ontario Food Processors on the Institute for Food Processing Technology in Cambridge and with the Ontario Industrial Roofing Contractors Association (OIRCA) for the Roofing Skills Training Centre in Waterloo.<br \/>    ...<br \/>    \"The single biggest factor affecting all stakeholders in the roofing sector today is the lack of a qualified workforce in the numbers necessary to service the needs of the construction industry in this province,\" said Don B. Marks, executive director of Ontario Industrial Roofing Contractors Association (OIRCA). \"We share Conestoga's vision that the Waterloo campus will become the focal point for the recruitment and training of construction workers in southern Ontario. The OIRCA\/Conestoga Roofing Skills Training Centre will allow the roofing industry to assume the responsibility to take control and manage its own human resources.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    For more information about the Knowledge Infrastructure Program, including program criteria, application instructions and a list of the approved projects to date, please visit <a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.ic.gc.ca\/knowledge-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">www.ic.gc.ca\/knowledge-infrastructure<\/a>.<br \/>    <br \/>    For information about how the Government of Ontario is helping to build and revitalize infrastructure across the province, please visit <a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.mei.gov.on.ca\/en\/infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">www.mei.gov.on.ca\/en\/infrastructure<\/a>.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/livable\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"green\">Livable Waterloo Region | Saturday August 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"02-14-2010 03:52 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"9"},"9299":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,555","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">865 Weber Street North, Waterloo<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.dtzbarnicke.com\/Client\/JJB\/JJBNA%20Web%20Listing%20db.nsf\/5b1d91a237abc91f852570d800775fbc\/bd98fd6a88e7b331852573d00059b3ea!OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.dtzbarnicke.com\/Client\/JJ...a!OpenDocument<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Lease<\/b><ul><li>Prime retail\/office development located in the King Street\/Hwy 85 commercial node.<\/li>   <li>Directly across from the St. Jacob's Farmers Market and future Smart Centre development.<\/li>   <li>C8 zoning allows for restaurant, medical clinic, financial establishment, automotive, hotel and many other uses.<\/li>   <\/ul>  <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.dtzbarnicke.com\/Client\/JJB\/JJBNA%20Web%20Listing%20db.nsf\/5b1d91a237abc91f852570d800775fbc\/bd98fd6a88e7b331852573d00059b3ea\/Picture\/0.142!OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>          <br \/>    <b>PROPERTY &amp;

Lexington Public School needs a $4.2-million expansion and facelift, including a 13-classroom addition, renovation and a new roof for the gym, and air conditioning for the school, a report to school board trustees says.<br \/>    <br \/>    The report also recommends building a brand-new elementary school on Falconridge Drive by 2014 in a fast growing area of new homes &#8212; with 825 still to be built &#8212; around Kiwanis Park.<br \/>    <br \/>    Trustees received the report Monday, but won&#8217;t vote on it until June.<br \/>    <br \/>    The report was written by an accommodation review committee studying the schools in the eastern part of Kitchener and Waterloo, including Bridgeport, Elizabeth Ziegler, Lexington, Margaret Avenue, Prueter and Suddaby public schools.<br \/>    <br \/>    An accommodation review committee is a group of parents, principals, staff and city officials who study shifting population trends in a certain area and make recommendations about closing schools, building new ones or changing boundaries.<br \/>    <br \/>    The schools in the eastern part of Kitchener-Waterloo have room for 2,866 students with the schools that are already there, plus 325 more with the proposed new school on Falconridge Drive, for a total of 3,191 spaces.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are only 2,429 students attending those schools. Even after population growth on the edge of the city is accounted for, there will only be 2,666 elementary students in 2015, staff predict.<br \/>    <br \/>    But board planner Lauren Manske said the committee decided not to recommend closing any schools in the area.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;What it came down to is that there was a lot of support for community-level schools,&#8221; she said. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Even if they are underutilized, if you were to take out any of those facilities, you&#8217;re abandoning the population in and around any one location.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Lexington Public School was closed for a time, and reopened in 1993 with a temporary extra wing with the idea that it might close again 15 to 20 years later, after the population started to age.<br \/>    <br \/>    The committee is recommending a permanent addition with 10 classrooms and three kindergarten rooms, renovations for the gym, and air conditioning. The renovations would be complete by 2012. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;There was very strong support to maintain a community school in the Lexington neighbourhood,&#8221; the report said.<br \/>    <br \/>    As for the school on Falconridge Drive, it would be for junior kindergarten to Grade 6, the report said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The committee felt it was important that as many students as possible have a school they can walk to. Because of the &#8220;relative isolation&#8221; of the community around Falconridge Drive, this isn&#8217;t possible for the children in that neighbourhood with the existing schools.<br \/>    <br \/>    The committee also recommended that a small group of children who attend Elizabeth Ziegler School and then go on to Margaret Avenue Public School for Grade 7 and 8 instead be directed to MacGregor Public School for those grades. <br \/>    <br \/>    This is because these few students lose almost all contact with their classmates from Elizabeth Ziegler for the two years of Grade 7 and 8. Then, most will rejoin their old friends again in Grade 9 at Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School.<br \/>    <br \/>    Allowing the students &#8212; there were only three in this position this year &#8212; to attend MacGregor with all their friends &#8220;will add a little bit of stability for these kids,&#8221; said Manske.<br \/>    <br \/>    To read the full report, go to the public school board&#8217;s website at wrdsb.ca and click &#8220;About,&#8221; then &#8220;Board meetings&#8221; then &#8220;Meeting agendas&#8221; and then &#8220;Committee of the Whole agenda, May 10.&#8221; The report is in the agenda.","signature":"","date":"05-13-2010 10:03 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"14"},"9317":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 563","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Today I noticed a bylaw change notice on a property just west of the intersection of Weber and Bridgeport.

Two of the 30 units, which are about 500 square feet, are wheelchair accessible and the building will be smoke-free.<br \/>    <br \/>    Group member Jan Lehman shed tears of joy when she saw the outcome of a project has been six years in the making.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;This is wonderful. It is worth every second,&#8221; Lehman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Most of the 15 members of the board behind SHOW are volunteers at Out of Cold programs and know that the people eating a free meal desperately need housing. There are between 50 and 70 persistent homeless people living on the streets of Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;This is going to turn their lives around,&#8221; said board member John Currie. &#8220;They are going to live a normal life again.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Board members are in the midst of interviewing potential tenants. More than 40 people have applied and a waiting list has been started. Most of the candidates are men, ranging in age from late 30s to early 60s, who have been homeless for about five years. A person must be homeless for at least a year to qualify.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Some have addiction issues. Others have drug problems. All need support,&#8221; Currie said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Barb Barnes, a board member who has interviewed potential tenants, said many can&#8217;t believe they may be soon living in a furnished apartment with support services to help them get back on their feet.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Many say &#8216;Wow. This is like Christmas,&#8217; &#8221; said Barnes, adding that one man couldn&#8217;t believe he would have his own washroom, instead of sharing one.<br \/>    <br \/>    Lehman said one man asked her, &#8220;Why are you doing this for us?&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Why would we not?&#8221; she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Currie said the board is looking for people who want to change their lives and get back into society. &#8220;We have had a tremendous response and all of them can&#8217;t wait to get in.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Our goal is to get them housed and keep them housed,&#8221; Siemens added.<br \/>    <br \/>    Though the project has faced many obstacles, most of them involving money, Siemens said the board was determined to make it happen.<br \/>    <br \/>    The building cost $5.45 million to build, of which $3.5 million was funded through federal and provincial infrastructure grants. Both the city and region waived development charges. Another $153,000 was provided under a federal homelessness program.<br \/>    <br \/>    The group has raised $555,000 and plans to mortgage the rest. The mortgage, which will not be locked in for a year, could be less than the projected $910,000 if the group succeeds in getting the $200,000 it owes in GST rescinded and raises more money from the community, Siemens said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The building&#8217;s operating costs will be covered by monthly rent payments of $464.<br \/>    <br \/>    Round-the-clock supportive care costs $300,000 a year and will be contracted out to groups such as Waterloo Regional Homes for Mental Health and the House of Friendship.<br \/>    <br \/>    In April, the regional government agreed to provide $225,000 a year toward that cost under its domiciliary hostel program, a cost-shared program with the province. This year, the region will also give a one-time grant of $75,000, but in future the group must cover that cost.<br \/>    <br \/>    Siemens said fundraising has been challenging because &#8220;there are people who don&#8217;t understand homelessness and how easily it can happen.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been just a fundraising campaign. It has been an education campaign as well,&#8221; she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Marriage breakup is the leading cause of homelessness in Canada, according to a fact sheet provided by the project&#8217;s board. Other causes are mental health problems, abuse, poverty and lack of affordable housing.<br \/>    <br \/>    According to the fact sheet, homeless people are among the least threatening group in society. Most often they are the victims of crime, not the perpetrators. <br \/>    <br \/>    About four years ago, a homeless man sleeping near the railroad tracks at King Street was set on fire. Another time, an alcoholic sleeping on a local street was beaten and urinated on by a group of youth, the sheet said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Since homeless people only have what is on their backs, the group has been collecting furniture, linen, dishes and cooking utensils to furnish the apartments. The &#8220;Adopt&#8211;a-Room&#8221; campaign has been very successful, with one church contributing $10,000 toward the purchase of new beds, Lehman said. More donations are needed, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The public can tour the facility at an open house on June 16, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Anyone can become homeless. Nobody has to remain homeless,&#8221; Lehman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:fbarrick@therecord.com\">fbarrick@therecord.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"05-21-2010 10:42 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"16"},"9323":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,555","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font color=\"red\">Conestoga - OIRCA Centre For Roofing Training &amp; Technology - May 28, 2010<\/font><\/b><br \/>    @ Waterloo Campus<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/Conestoga-OIRCACentreForRoofingTrai.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/Conestoga-OIRCACentreForRoofingT-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    Placement to the west of the Conestoga - Ontario Masonry Training Centre<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/Conestoga-OIRCACentreForRoofingT-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/livable\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"green\">Livable Waterloo Region | Saturday August 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"05-28-2010 07:42 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"17"},"9324":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,555","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font color=\"red\">332 Marsland Drive, Waterloo - May 28, 2010<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/332MarslandDriveWaterloo-May282010-.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/332MarslandDriveWaterloo-May2820-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/332MarslandDriveWaterloo-May2820-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/livable\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"green\">Livable Waterloo Region | Saturday August 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"05-28-2010 08:02 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"18"},"9325":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,555","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Conestoga Opens New Roofing Skills Centre in Waterloo<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    May 27, 2010 10:38 AM | <a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/blogs1.conestogac.on.ca\/news\/2010\/05\/conestoga_opens_new_roofing_sk.php\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/blogs1.conestogac.on.ca\/news\/...roofing_sk.php<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"red\">More than 100 industry, education and government representatives gathered on May 25 in Waterloo for the official opening of the new, 12,400 sq. ft. Conestoga\/OIRCA Roofing Skills Training Centre, a project of Conestoga and the Ontario Industrial Roofing Contractors Association. <\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    In order to promote economic development, increase educational opportunity and help the institution grow to meet employer needs, Conestoga has received federal and provincial funding totalling $72 million for new and expanded Conestoga facilities in Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge and Guelph, through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program and Ontario's 2009 Budget.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Knowledge Infrastructure Program (KIP), a two-year, $2 billion economic stimulus measure to support infrastructure enhancement at Canadian post-secondary institutions, is part of the $12 billion in new infrastructure investment allocated under Canada's Economic Action Plan. The KIP is providing real economic stimulus and employment by creating local jobs for engineers, architects, tradespeople and technicians. It is also helping to generate the advanced technological infrastructure needed to keep Canada's research and educational facilities at the forefront of scientific advancement. <br \/>    <br \/>    Speaking at the May 25 event, the Hon. Gary Goodyear, MP for Cambridge, Minister of State for Science and Technology and Minister of State responsible for the Federal Development Agency for Southern Ontario, said, \"It is clear that colleges, with their many strengths, are deserving of federal funding support. Our plan is not just to create jobs for today, which KIP projects certainly do, but also to create the better jobs of tomorrow. All this is possible because of all levels of government working together - federal, provincial and municipal.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The opening of the new Roofing Skills Centre at Conestoga College is a marvelous example of our community building and growing together,\" said Leeanna Pendergast, MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga. \"This timely collaboration is meeting an important industry's need for highly skilled tradespersons who will train at this state-of-the-art facility. The Ontario government is very pleased to make this significant commitment since it will undoubtedly lead to immediate job creation and strengthen our local economy for many years to come.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    The Government of Ontario, in its 2009 budget - Confronting the Challenge: Building Ontario's Economic Future -- is committed to investing in infrastructure and has designated $780 million to colleges and universities to modernize facilities and boost long-term research and skills training capacity over the next two years.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Conestoga\/OIRCA facility is at Conestoga's Waterloo campus site and sits adjacent to the Conestoga\/OMTC Masonry Training Centre, which officially opened in the spring of 2009. The roofing facility features two spacious classroom areas, a large shop area presenting space to work on a number of roofing skills projects employing various techniques, and an outdoor, canopied project work area. Its opening marks another step in Conestoga's goal of creating at Waterloo a centre of excellence for construction trades skills. The main campus building in Waterloo also houses Conestoga's many culinary skills programs, and students from those programs prepared and served all the refreshments at the May 25 event. <br \/>    <br \/>    Conestoga President John Tibbits told the event audience, \"We've had excellent partnerships with industry and government in creating these training centres for masonry and roofing skills. It's worth noting that these projects have been completed on time and on budget. The benefits from these projects and others now underway at Conestoga include not only the considerable person-hours of work created in our communities, but also the imparting of high-value skills education for those communities and the expansion of learning opportunities to many thousands of additional students.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    Ontario's roofing industry is currently facing a significant challenge due to a lack of skilled tradespeople entering this profession. This multi-disciplinary trade, which blends principles from design, architecture, engineering and various forms of construction, requires highly trained individuals to master modern project delivery. It further requires a significant bridging of knowledge from current practitioners to newly trained professionals, who are well versed in the use of the latest materials and techniques.<br \/>    <br \/>    On behalf of OIRCA, Executive Director Don Marks stated, \"The key to a strong economy for our future lies in the college system. I feel that the Waterloo campus will become a major portal for the future of our industry-whether through young people discovering an excellent career option, students seeking new directions through initiatives like Second Career, or the improvement of skills for those already employed in the trade.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    CONTACT: Conestoga - John Sawicki, <a href=\"mailto:jsawicki@conestogac.on.ca\">jsawicki@conestogac.on.ca<\/a>; Julie Gillis, <a href=\"mailto:jgillis@conestogac.on.ca\">jgillis@conestogac.on.ca<\/a> | OIRCA - Don Marks, 416-695-4114, 1-888-336-4722","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/livable\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"green\">Livable Waterloo Region | Saturday August 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"06-01-2010 02:59 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"19"},"9326":{"user":{"name":"Duke-of-Waterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100908012329im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=24&amp;dateline=1272669526","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo, ON    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 568","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Does anyone know what all the construction is for at <a href=\"\/web\/20100908012329\/http:\/\/bci.wrdsb.on.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bluevale Collegiate Institute<\/a>?

I don't even want to flatter them by calling them &quot;stucco&quot;, because true stucco has some texture.<br \/>   <br \/>   I much prefer Cripple Creek.","signature":"","date":"09-22-2010 09:08 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"86"},"15103":{"user":{"name":"Urban_Enthusiast86","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"339"}},"content":"A wonderful modern example of the tasteful use of brick.","signature":"","date":"09-22-2010 09:28 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"87"},"15105":{"user":{"name":"mpd618","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"948"}},"content":"I love the windows and the waves of brick.","signature":"","date":"09-22-2010 09:55 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"88"},"15106":{"user":{"name":"fin2limb","avatar":"\/web\/20110226030022im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=402&amp;dateline=1283294803","title":"Hamlet Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, Ontario","member_since":"Jul 2010","num_posts":"46"}},"content":"Wow!

That along with 188 would make for some good density, with some good variety of design.","signature":"","date":"01-09-2010 11:14 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"9370":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20110226030705im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Conurbation Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5033"}},"content":"Re:  36-40 Regina St. North.  <a href=\"\/web\/20110226030705\/http:\/\/www.dtzbarnicke.com\/Client\/JJB\/JJB_LP4W_LND_WebStation.nsf\/resources\/Market+Listings+PDF\/$file\/officecat_Q1_Q2_08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.dtzbarnicke.com\/Client\/JJ...t_Q1_Q2_08.pdf<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   I like the design of it.

A consultant will be hired to determine locations where demand is greatest, and identify the size and type of shelter or shelters required.<br \/>    <br \/>   Although the city already provides a number of bicycle parking spots, they\u2019re essentially racks that aren\u2019t protected from the elements, said the city\u2019s director of transportation, Phil Hewitson.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to get their bikes stolen or vandalized,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>   Hewitson said interested groups such as bicycle clubs and shops will be surveyed, and a public information session will likely be held to solicit ideas. The two levels of government will split the project\u2019s cost.<br \/>    <br \/>   Increasing the use of alternative forms of transportation, such as cycling, public transit and walking, is a theme in the city\u2019s official plan and transportation master plan. Waterloo\u2019s transportation and trails advisory committee has said a premier bike parking structure downtown is needed.<br \/>    <br \/>   The provincial program providing the grant was developed to support municipal plans that help to reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.<br \/>    <br \/>   \u201cFor every bicycle on the road, there\u2019s one less car,\u201d Hewitson said.<br \/>    <br \/>   Initially, the city will look to install the structures on land it owns.

The firm has acquired the 1.5 acre Bauer Estate located at 31 Union Street, Waterloo and will be working over the next year to make the property the new home of our K-W office. After many months of working with the City of Waterloo together with our planners, architects and other consultants, Waterloo City Council approved our applications for Official Plan Amendment and Zone Change on December 16, 2008. Both Council and the area residents appreciated our efforts to preserve the architectural and heritage features of the site.<br \/>    The Bauer Estate consists of a 8,200 sq. ft. century home that was originally built for the Seagram family but was purchased by the Bauer family as their residence in 1965. We will be maintaining the original home and constructing a large addition that will be connected to the home by a glass causeway.<br \/>    When completed, our new location will have a total building floor area of almost 27,000 sq. ft. with entrances off both Union and Herbert Streets and ample on-site parking. This new location will give the firm plenty of room to expand so as to better serve the needs of our clients. We have included two elevation drawings and the draft site plan to give you an idea of what to expect.<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLawNewsletterWinter2009-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLawNewsletterWinter2009-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLawNewsletterWinter2009-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"red\">March 29, 2010<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLaw-31UnionStreetEast-Marc-3.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLaw-31UnionStreetEast-Marc-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLaw-31UnionStreetEast-Marc-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/SobaraLaw-31UnionStreetEast-March29.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"","date":"03-30-2010 11:42 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"41"},"9483":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3554"}},"content":"<b><font color=\"red\">Cripple Creek (47 Union Street East, Waterloo) - March 29, 2010<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/CrippleCreek-47UnionStreetEast-M-9.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/CrippleCreek-47UnionStreetEast-M-8.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/CrippleCreek-47UnionStreetEast-M-7.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/CrippleCreek-47UnionStreetEast-M-6.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/CrippleCreek-47UnionStreetEast-M-5.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"","date":"03-30-2010 12:11 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"42"},"9492":{"user":{"name":"urbandreamer","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"138"}},"content":"Re:  Sorbara Law.

The law firm won over the neighbourhood because it was going to restore and maintain the historic building.<br \/>   <br \/>   Now the sun beats down on her backyard with an intensity she&#8217;s never known before and that&#8217;s a big problem for Whittington, who runs a home-based daycare centre. Whittington can&#8217;t let young children play in the yard because provincial law says 45 per cent of the outdoor play area must be shaded.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Normally on a hot day we would picnic outside, play in the pool and come in for a nap,&#8221; Whittington said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The historic home faces Union Street on a large, L-shaped lot that also fronts on Herbert Street. It was covered with mature trees. The law firm needed an amendment to the city&#8217;s Official Plan to allow commercial offices in a neighbourhood zoned for low-density residential housing.<br \/>   <br \/>   That&#8217;s when neighbouring property owners made their views clear at two public meetings in the fall of 2008. They supported the move if the mature trees were left in place and an old brick wall was left standing. They also wanted some buffering between their homes and the law offices.<br \/>   <br \/>   The neighbours thought they had been heard.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I was under the impression they were going to only take down trees that were not doing well,&#8221; Whittington said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Whittington is supported by Barry Ralph, who lives at 263 Herbert St., who thought the residents concerns were taken seriously.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We felt the developer was being fair and would do things in a way that would make everyone happy,&#8221; Ralph said. &#8220;The meetings were very positive.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   When Waterloo city councillors approved the changes to the Official Plan in December 2008, the staff report stated the new owners wanted to maintain a number of mature trees on the property. They would prepare a tree preservation plan and a landscape plan. The report said that existing mature trees along the side and rear boundary would be maintained.<br \/>   <br \/>   But after the public meetings were held, the city and representatives of the law firm finalized plans for cutting down most of the trees. The nearby residents were not told.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;That is where, fundamentally, the process fell down,&#8221; Jeff Casello, of 259 Herbert St., said. &#8220;I am concerned about the process.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   When Casello asked why nearby homeowners were not informed about the final plans, he was told there are no laws or regulations that require city officials to share such information.<br \/>   <br \/>   Casello, a University of Waterloo professor specializing in transportation planning and urban intensification, said that approach to planning is old fashioned and must change if city councils expect existing residents to support changes that add new uses to existing neighbourhoods.<br \/>   <br \/>   It is anachronistic to think mature trees are disposable, Casello said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Casello and his neighbours knew something was up when they heard chainsaws ripping through the trees at about 6:30 p.m. Monday. He tried to get contact someone at City Hall, but the offices had emptied for the day.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;They just simply cut down almost all the trees,&#8221; Casello said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Coun. Diane Freeman is sympathetic to the residents concerns. Freeman said the city should adopt a new policy to communicate the final plans for infill projects to residents who have attended public meetings.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I think that is a fair comment,&#8221; Freeman said of Casello&#8217;s concerns.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;If there is one positive that can come out of our hardship and loss, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Casello said of policy change to keep residents better informed.<br \/>   <br \/>   Scott Patterson, a planning consultant who represented the law firm, said the trees had to come down to make room for the parking lot, the grading of the site, stormwater management and to make room for a three-storey addition to the rear of the historic house.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;There was a tree-management plan prepared for the city,&#8221; Patterson said.<br \/>   <br \/>   A large black walnut tree is being retained.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I see that as a positive,&#8221; Patterson said.","signature":"","date":"05-28-2010 05:19 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"47"},"9811":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3554"}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>RangersFan<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110226031014\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=9460#post9460\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">Yesterday when walking by the Waterloo Hotel I noticed that the basement was being renovated (new walls\/drywall, floors etc)<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     <b><font color=\"red\">The Waterloo Hotel Basement (2 King Street North) - June 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><br \/>     <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/TheWaterlooHotelBasement2KingStreet.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110226031014\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/219-Light-Rail-Transit?p=25288#post25288\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"darkgreen\">cc LRT Letters to <a href=\"mailto:letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com\">letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/a><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"06-27-2010 06:35 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"48"},"12881":{"user":{"name":"jay","avatar":"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=5&amp;dateline=1268703480","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Bauer Lofts, Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"665"}},"content":"Good riddance to quiznos.<br \/>   <br \/>   Now if only they would start 188 king st s or 133 park.","signature":"","date":"07-16-2010 01:35 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"49"},"10785":{"user":{"name":"mpd618","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"949"}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>jay<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110226031014\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=10561#post10561\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110226031014im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">Now if only they would start 188 king st s or 133 park.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     The houses on the 133 Park site have been abandoned for a while now (though the grass is still mowed).

Jan. 18, Lang&#8217;s Farm applied for $10 million from FedDev Ontario, another job creation and community building program with $1 billion to spend over five years.<br \/>    <br \/>    Davidson has no idea when a decision on the funding will be made, so he&#8217;s arranging a meeting with Cambridge MPP Gary Goodyear and Mayor Doug Craig &#8220;to see how we can move this forward.&#8221; Goodyear oversees FedDev as minister of science and technology.<br \/>    <br \/>    Davidson is eager to get out of rented space that&#8217;s not big enough to handle growing community needs. Last year, more than 8,000 people attend programs, meetings or received care in the building, provided by 15 different agencies.<br \/>    <br \/>    Lang&#8217;s Farm spends $300,000 a year on rent for space in 20,000 square feet in a commercial building at Lang&#8217;s and Trico drives. A new building could easily serve double the number of clients it does today, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    That&#8217;s money better spent on a mortgage or programs. Davidson expects some of the agencies now using Lang&#8217;s space would partner in the new building, either to help pay for it or to rent space after its open.<br \/>    <br \/>    As Cambridge Memorial Hospital unloads programs to community agencies and health providers, there&#8217;s a chance for Lang&#8217;s to expand its existing community health clinic. Already, Lang&#8217;s is talking about hosting dental clinics for low-income residents. Davidson said expanded diabetes treatment or stroke recovery programs could by hosted by Langs in a new building.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge has $50,000 set aside for the design work in the proposed 2010 city budget, with another $2.2 million for design and construction of a seniors &#8220;wellness centre&#8221; in 2014-2015.<br \/>    <br \/>    The goal this year is to sort out the best way to co-ordinate the needs of the Lang&#8217;s clients and city seniors programs, said Kent McVittie, community services commissioner.<br \/>    <br \/>    Last year, the city rejected a call from some seniors to build a central seniors recreation complex. Instead, seniors programs would remain decentralized, with programs in Hespeler, Preston and Galt. The Allan Reuter Centre &#8212; in the former Preston town hall &#8212; would be partly replaced by the city&#8217;s share of the new Lang&#8217;s Farm complex, including a long-wanted large community meeting hall for social functions.<br \/>    <br \/>    Exactly how the city and Lang&#8217;s will share construction costs haven&#8217;t been sorted out, McVittie said. <br \/>    <br \/>    If Lang&#8217;s gets the federal grant &#8220;the city&#8217;s share would be significantly reduced,&#8221; he said.","signature":"","date":"02-02-2010 12:35 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"9639":{"user":{"name":"Duke-of-Waterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=24&amp;dateline=1290460886","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"1026"}},"content":"<b><u><font color=\"Blue\"><font size=\"4\">Drug treatment centre approved near Cambridge high school<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   <i>THE RECORD | Tuesday, February 23, 2010 | <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232305\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/CanadaWorld\/article\/674738\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Canad...article\/674738<\/a><\/i><br \/>   <br \/>   <b>CAMBRIDGE<\/b> &#8212; Downtown Galt already has too many social service agencies, Coun.

You feel like you&#8217;re in a small town.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   He and his wife Natasa moved from Kitchener to Hespeler in 2007 and bought a three-storey commercial building at Queen and Adam streets. <br \/>   <br \/>   The building was in tough shape and had a dodgy reputation, since it housed a massage parlour on the upper floors.<br \/>   <br \/>   They gutted it, refinished it and rented out the main floor to a coffee shop. The rest become their home, complete with restored pine floors, bare interior brick walls and a rooftop balcony out back.<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s what de Villiers has in mind to bring life back to the grubby Hespeler Hotel just a block down Queen, at Tannery Street. City officials were a big help with converting the property at Queen and Adam and are ready again with advice, grants and loans to help restore the old hotel, de Villiers said.<br \/>   <br \/>   When the couple bought the heritage stone building from Andre Watteel in February, it housed two commercial units below and nine apartments upstairs. The commercial space will stay, as will three or four overhauled apartments. The rest will convert to rental office space.<br \/>   <br \/>   Three tenants remain&#8212;for now&#8212;as the renovations get underway on the second floor. The couple started swinging hammers last month to chisel away concrete parging covering the inside stone walls. <br \/>   <br \/>   They plan to do as much of the work as they can, when not at their day jobs. He&#8217;s a sales manager at RIM and she works at Humber College in Toronto.<br \/>   <br \/>   The building shell is structurally sound, de Villiers said. Most of the rebuilding will be out back, where a badly sloping second floor must be ripped out and replaced as a cathedral ceiling is installed over the new office space.<br \/>   <br \/>   On the main floor a tenant will open the Five-Fifteen music bar. <br \/>   <br \/>   The most visible part of the makeover will likely be out front, where de Villiers plans to rebuild a second-floor balcony overhanging the sidewalk. It&#8217;s been gone since the 1940s.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We&#8217;ve really got high expectations of what this can become. We&#8217;re interested in the historic restoration.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   A driveway along the east side of the building leads down to an unusual basement. Beside the door to a one-time laundromat, there&#8217;s a brick archway big enough to drive a car through. It marks a wide passage under the main floor and around to a rear yard where a stable once stood to house traveller&#8217;s horses.<br \/>   <br \/>   If de Villiers&#8217; dreams unfold as planned, the secluded space beside, under and behind the old hotel will become a restaurant patio. &#8220;There&#8217;s so much potential for this space.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Restoration may end up costing $300,000 by the time upwards of 15,000 square feet is rejuvenated over the next few years, de Villiers said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;A lot of people have told me I&#8217;ve bitten off more than I can chew. It&#8217;s a massive project.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   He is convinced Hespeler&#8217;s renaissance is underway. He sees a few building owners taking the lead to clean up buildings, which encourages others to do the same. There&#8217;s also the challenge of bringing the right stores to the area, to serve customers fed up with impersonal big box store shopping, de Villiers said.<br \/>   <br \/>   West along Queen Street, work is underway to refinish the exterior of Ernie&#8217;s Roadhouse. Owner Rob Cox also believes in Hespeler&#8217;s core after watching five years of improvement. The restoration job shows his confidence to stay.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s expensive. It&#8217;s either we&#8217;re staying for the next 25 years or we&#8217;ll get out now.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener developer Shawky Fahel has city approval to for a $30 million transformation of the old American Standard factory into 140 upscale condominiums and street level stores. Work is expected to start by summer along the Speed River, with people moving in by the end of 2011.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I think Queen Street can turn into a little St. Jacobs. There&#8217;s potential of turning the whole village of Hespeler into a very, very big urban renaissance area,&#8221; he said<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Everybody creates a little ripple and it will create an urban renewal wave.&#8221;","signature":"","date":"02-28-2010 07:14 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"9653":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"765"}},"content":"<b>Downtown Galt faces building boom<\/b><br \/>   March 07, 2010 | Kevin Swayze<br \/>   <br \/>   CAMBRIDGE &#8212; There&#8217;s a change underway in old Galt&#8217;s skyline that hasn&#8217;t been seen for a generation.<br \/>   <br \/>   Construction cranes are slinging concrete and materials to two new residential projects: a seven story, 66-unit Heartwood Place apartment building on Ainslie Street across from the bus terminal and a 12-storey, 115-apartment Waterscape condominium tower at the north intersection of Water and Ainslie streets.<br \/>   <br \/>   More changes may be in store in the picture-postcard collection of historic buildings along the Grand River.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We see and we&#8217;ve heard of a need for a meeting and convention hotel facility in the core area,&#8221; said Paul de Haas, whose company is building the $30-million Waterscape building, with a twin planned beside it in a few years.<br \/>   <br \/>   If a hotel becomes a reality in downtown Cambridge, it could go on vacant &#8212; and at present, contaminated &#8212; land between Waterscape and the mill restaurant at Water Street and Parkhill Road. <br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;This is one of the options we are actively exploring,&#8221; de Haas said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Aaron Ciacone runs the Ancaster Old Mill and is ready to start a $5 million renovation this spring on the stone mill restaurant he owns in Cambridge.

Plans are also underway to convert the former Royal Hotel at Main and Wellington streets and the former shoe factory at Concession and Water Streets into condominiums, too.<br \/>   <br \/>   On Main Street, between Ainslie and Water, David Gibson&#8212;a key player in the renaissance of downtown Waterloo&#8212;spent $3.5 million to buy up seven storefronts with plans for redevelopment into trendy restaurants and retail within walking distance of the river. His first tenant is modest: a discount department store opened in part of the old Right House store a week ago.

I used to live in Galt before I moved to Waterloo and I worked there all my life until now.  It's a VERY blue collar town and these people love suburbia.  I used to joke with my girlfriend that the only thing that survives in Cambridge is a Walmart. Downtown Galt would need more Universities first and I doubt that is going happen especially since they are not getting LRT.  I think if Kitchener and Waterloo do merge then Cambridge will never get another school or anything from the two cities and the mayor knows it.<br \/>   <br \/>   Downtown Galt has a lot of old buildings but it's in a real state right now and I can't see that changing for a long time.  Hopefully the Drayton Theatre helps it out, but if you ask 10 residents in Cambridge 8 of them would oppose it.  Heck all my neighbours and workers used to complain that Cambridge had to give money to Conestoga for the new college. Of course I know everyone in the city doesn't think this way but in all my years there the one thing I noticed is that they have a different mentality then most people in KW.<br \/>   <br \/>   I don't know why they can't attract any white collar jobs but it must be something because they have a lot of buildings for sale and empty in Cambridge, with a lot of them with 401 access and advertising.  But one problem is most of the buildings are factory style and are not really practical for office jobs and also they are owned by huge corporations who just let the building sit there and then they white it off. My dad owned a tool &amp; die shop beside Nova Steel on the 401, and before he got bought out he said the way manufacturing is heading in North america my building will be worth nothing only the land which would be sold at a fire sale price.  Nova Steel and Venture Steel across the street have been empty for years and those are big buildings on a lot of land.<br \/>   <br \/>   I still wonder what Kitchener plans to do with Budds.","signature":"","date":"03-09-2010 12:16 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"9660":{"user":{"name":"Urbanomicon","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=99&amp;dateline=1266346234","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, Ontario","member_since":"Feb 2010","num_posts":"1000"}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>Bauer123<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110207232305\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=2777#post2777\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">I still wonder what Kitchener plans to do with Budds.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     The last rumour I heard was that Samsung may take it over and use it to help build 200 wind turbines for the big wind turbine contract they won from the provincial government.<br \/>    <br \/>   More information on the deal can be found here: <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232305\/http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/money\/story\/2009\/09\/28\/samsung-wind-farm-ontario.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/money\/story\/2009\/0...m-ontario.html<\/a>","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

Whoever is hired would, at first, determine if the concrete dam is structurally sound and able to take a dynamo at the western end.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We do want to get this moving,&#8221; said Dave Schlutz, spokesperson for the conservation authority.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 1999, a power plant feasibility study by the authority and Cambridge-North Dumfries hydro found a power plant possible, but financially impractical at the time. Today, the province is encouraging &#8220;green&#8221; power by paying a premium rate for electricity generated by dams on 40 year contracts.<br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s estimated to cost $4.8 million to install a generating station at Parkhill. With the sweetened power rates, the project could pay for itself in five to seven years. <br \/>    <br \/>    The authority already runs power plants at the Conestogo, Shand and Guelph Lake dams. Parkhill would be the largest, generating about 1.3 megawatts of electricity. That&#8217;s enough to power about 2,000 homes. <br \/>    <br \/>    The Parkhill Dam was built in 1837 to create a mill pond along the Grand River at the village of Galt. That supplied a steady flow of water to power grist and textile mills along the east side of the river. The Riverbank Mill and Mill Race Park are the only remnants of the water-powered industries that employed hundreds in old Galt until the middle of the 20th century.<br \/>    <br \/>    Thursday&#8217;s approval is the first of many steps to install an electrical generation station Parkhill. Once the conservation authority confirms the dam is sound and the final costs of installing a power plant, then a purchase-of-power contract must be negotiated with the Ontario Power Authority to confirm a guaranteed revenue stream to replay loans to build the dynamo.<br \/>    <br \/>    Along the way, an environmental study must be completed to produce final details for the power station. &#8220;Notification and consultation&#8221; with First Nations communities would be part of the approval process, an authority report says.","signature":"","date":"04-08-2010 07:29 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"11"},"9701":{"user":{"name":"DKsan","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"95"}},"content":"How far down the Grand River is this?<br \/>   <br \/>   I'm not too familiar with Cambridge geography.","signature":"","date":"04-08-2010 09:29 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"12"},"9702":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"765"}},"content":"Its in Downtown Galt so pretty far down if your in Waterloo.","signature":"","date":"04-08-2010 10:59 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"13"},"9761":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110207232305im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3576"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">SITE PLAN APPLICATION SP10\/10, PEOPLECARE INC., HILLTOP MANOR, 42 ELLIOTT STREET<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    To: COUNCIL | Date of Meeting: June 21, 2010<br \/>    Prepared By: Rosa Bustamante, Planner | Department: Planning Services<br \/>    Report No.: <a href=\"\/web\/20110207232305\/http:\/\/www.cambridge.ca\/cs_pubaccess\/download_minutes.php?doc_id=5823\" target=\"_blank\">P\/10-48<\/a> | Pages 33-57<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Recommendation(s):<\/b><br \/>    THAT Cambridge Council approve in principle, the site plan application by PeopleCare Inc. to permit the development of a four-storey expansion to the Hilltop Manor Nursing Home at 42 Elliott Street, to accommodate an additional 96 long-term care beds as detailed in planning report P\/10-48;<br \/>    AND THAT the Commissioner of Planning Services be authorized to sign off on the site plan agreement when all outstanding technical matters have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Site Plan Control Committee and the Commissioner of Transportation and Public Works.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>LOCATION AND PROPOSAL<\/b><br \/>    The site is located on the north side of Elliott Street, west of Centre Street, is municipally known as 42 Elliott Street, and legally described as Part of Lot 12, Plan 445.

But that theatre did not want to screen other festival offerings during the weekend.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cTry to get Friday, Saturday, Sunday, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Nakamura said. <br \/>    <br \/>    It was the same for other commercial cinemas with 35-mm projectors.<br \/>    <br \/>    The school of architecture in Cambridge hosts festival screenings on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but not during the week because of lectures.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cAnd the problem there is it\u2019s on a Christi Digital Projector, it\u2019s not 35-mm,\u201d Nakamura said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Nakamura said he would like to the see the 650-seat Drayton Festival Theatre, which will be constructed in Cambridge next year, become the permanent home for the Grand River Film Festival in that city.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe are in discussions,\u201d Nakamura said. <br \/>    <br \/>    The 500-seat Gig Theatre on Ontario Street in downtown Kitchener is an ideal location for the festival\u2019s permanent home.<br \/>    <br \/>    Nakamura said a corporate sponsor or sponsors are needed so the festival can buy and install 35-mm projectors and sound systems in those two locations.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cMy God, we are community of 500,000 people, we deserve this. Come on, Sudbury\u2019s film festival is in its 21 year,\u201d Nakamura said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cinefest, the Sudbury International Film Festival, quickly established itself as the fourth largest film festival in the country after it started in 1988. It is held immediately following the Toronto International Film Festival and screens many galas and features from TIFF. <br \/>    <br \/>    The organizers of the Sudbury Film Festival screen all of their movies at a single multiplex cinema. There is a gala every night of the festival, which ran from Sept. 19 to 27 this year. The after-parties are held at a variety of locations around that city every night.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Cinefest Galas included Precious, the latest movie from Lee Daniels, which won the Audience Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. That movie is not slated for general release until next month.<br \/>    <br \/>    Until the organizers of the Grand River Film Festival can secure large venues with 35-mm projectors, they are trying to build audiences by adding another layer of experience \u2014 directors, writers and stunt specialists will attend this year\u2019s festival.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe are trying to put the sizzle in front of the movie,\u201d Nakamura said. \u201cAs much as possible we are trying to get actors, directors, etc., to come and support it.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    It cost $18,000 to bring Yojiro Takita and his wife to the Grand River Film Festival from Japan. He directed Departures, which won this year\u2019s Best Foreign Language Oscar. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI am very proud of that, bringing an Oscar-winning director to this region.

The term remains four years.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener is adding four councillors. Cambridge is adding two councillors. The total number of municipal politicians in the region will grow by six to 57.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo residents and some others will be asked by referendum if they want to continue fluoridating drinking water.<br \/>    <br \/>    Pro-reform residents had called on politicians to merge some local councils in 2010, saying this would streamline municipal government. Their effort, launched in 2008, got little traction and politicians chose instead to tinker with the election.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed but we&#8217;re not discouraged,&#8221; said Jim Erb, spokesperson for the group Citizens for Better Government. He said he hopes candidates make reform a municipal election issue.<br \/>    <br \/>    Local mayors applaud the provincial government for advancing the election to the fourth Monday in October. It&#8217;s hoped this change will improve turnout.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The date will probably make it more convenient for people,&#8221; said Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, who has not decided whether to seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    The new date shortens the long municipal campaign by a few days, sets the election in potentially better weather, and gives local governments more time to prepare for the inauguration of new councils.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge council is expanding to nine members in the election. Kitchener council is expanding to 11. Proponents contend expansions will improve governance and spread the council workload around.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It will allow for a wider diversity of opinion on council, and of course representation,&#8221; said Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig, who is seeking re-election. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very good news for everybody.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;You have a chance of having more representation and more views on a subject, so that&#8217;s a good thing from a democratic standpoint,&#8221; Zehr said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Zehr expects the next Kitchener council will be mostly newcomers, as council opens up four new seats and some incumbents decline to see re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo council is staying at eight members. Regional council is staying at 16, including seven mayors. Four townships are staying at five members each.<br \/>    <br \/>    The municipal campaign formally launches Jan. 4, the first day candidates can register for office. They must register before they can raise money or spend it.<br \/>    <br \/>    Zehr and Craig want local politicians to debate municipal reform during the next council term. Regional Chair Ken Seiling doubts reform will happen until provincial politicians signal their interest in shaping it.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Clearly the province hasn&#8217;t shown an interest in touching municipal structures,&#8221; said Seiling, who has not announced if he will seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ontario has made changes to financing rules for the municipal election. The province will also require more accessible voting places.","signature":"","date":"12-29-2009 12:09 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"07-19-2010 03:51 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"2"},"10937":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100822011327im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,172","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Candidates gear up for municipal elections<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    January 04, 2010<br \/>    By Melinda Dalton, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO REGION \u2014 Municipal elections may still be months away, but the race is on already in several communities across Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Monday marked the first official day candidates could register for the October elections in the three cities and the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    First out of the gate in Waterloo was Mayor Brenda Halloran, who registered her bid for a second term.<br \/>    <br \/>    Close behind was Waterloo Ward 6 Coun.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing that there\u2019s some change. The degree of change is going to be a big issue in terms of learning to work together and what priorities new people might bring.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    To date, only two councillors \u2014 Berry Vrbanovic and John Gazzola \u2014 as well as Mayor Carl Zehr have registered as candidates. Add in the city\u2019s four newly created wards and that leaves at minimum six and at most eight wards without an incumbent.<br \/>    <br \/>    In the 2006 municipal election, only one council seat changed hands.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kelly Galloway won the South Ward after the incumbent \u2014 her brother Mike Galloway \u2014 decided not to run. Galloway has yet to decide whether she will make another bid for the seat.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ward 5 Coun. Geoff Lorentz, who narrowly won his seat in the last election, announced last week he will run as a Kitchener representative on regional council. Lorentz previously served as a regional councillor from 1992 to 2000, when regional councillors also served on their local councils. His career on Kitchener council spans 22 years.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ward 3 Coun. John Smola has not declared and could not be reached for comment. Victoria Park (Ward 6) Coun. Christina Weylie confirmed earlier this year she will not seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    As of Wednesday, 20 candidates have registered as mayoral or councillor candidates in Kitchener. Gazzola and Vrbanovic are currently running uncontested. There is one other mayoral candidate registered.<br \/>    <br \/>    The hottest race so far, with four candidates already declared, is the new Ward 9, which takes in much of Weylie\u2019s former constituency.<br \/>    <br \/>    Without familiar faces to fall back on, voters in many city wards will have to \u201cdo their homework\u201d \u2014 get out to meetings, listen to candidates and read up on their platforms, said Williams.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThere is a downside to just picking the familiar name because it may be that people are selected because people aren\u2019t willing to invest the time to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be an effective citizen, I think this time you are going to have to pay more attention.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener is the only city in the region with only a fraction of sitting councillors confirming their names will be on the municipal ballot this fall.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Waterloo, all councillors except Ian McLean and Mark Whaley have confirmed they\u2019ll seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    McLean, who has served two terms, announced Tuesday he will not run again. Whaley said only that he\u2019s \u201cas yet undeclared.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    That leaves Waterloo\u2019s Ward 6, and Ward 7 \u2014 vacated by Coun. Jan d\u2019Ailly, who is challenging Mayor Brenda Halloran for council\u2019s top spot \u2014 without incumbents.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Cambridge, all of the current members of council are registered as candidates. Coun. Linda Whetham is running for mayor so, with the addition of two new wards, three seats in that city will be without an incumbent.<br \/>    <br \/>    At the regional level, four incumbents have registered as candidates for the nine elected seats, including the regional chair. The mayors of the region\u2019s seven municipalities are automatically members of regional council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Candidates have until Sept. 10 to register for the election.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:mdalton@therecord.com\">mdalton@therecord.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"07-07-2010 10:20 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"14"},"10968":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100822011327im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,172","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"I know it's a little early to be thinking election, but as a resident of ward 9 in Kitchener, I'll be seeing some change in council (thankfully) so I thought I'd shoot the candidates an email.

To be eligible to be on the ballot, you have to prove you live or own land in the city and are legally allowed to vote.<br \/>   <br \/>   Robert Williams, a retired political science professor from the University of Waterloo and municipal politics expert, said despite a widely held perception that a city councillor ought to live in the area they represent, it&#8217;s not necessarily a predictor of a successful or effective candidate.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It can be done by people who live elsewhere but can persuade the community that they are a good choice and they&#8217;re a legitimate voice,&#8221; he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s really about the candidate trying to sell himself or herself as an informed voice for some of the interests in the ward.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener Coun. John Gazzola, who has represented Ward 3 since he was elected in a 2002 byelection, does not live in that ward. He is the only sitting councillor who does not live in the ward he represents. His first race for the Ward 3 seat pitted him against eight other candidates, only three of whom lived in the area.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Gazzola&#8217;s case, Williams said, he sold himself as someone with a broad view of the interests of the municipality and a lot of experience, given his former position as the city&#8217;s chief administrative officer.<br \/>   <br \/>   It proved successful and he&#8217;s been re-elected twice in that same ward.<br \/>   <br \/>   In the 2006 election, seven out of 26 candidates in Kitchener ran outside of their wards of residence.<br \/>   <br \/>   Len Carter was one of those seven. He lived in Ward 3 but mounted an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Ward 2 council seat. He did so in part because he supported Gazzola and didn&#8217;t want to run against him.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It was about who I wanted to see on council,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t run a huge campaign, but I wanted (incumbent Berry Vrbanovic) to know that there was some opposition there.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Part of what could be contributing to this year&#8217;s ward-jumping could be the fact that the number of wards was expanded and each one now represents a smaller area, Williams said. Kitchener has moved from a six to 10 ward system, shifting around some of the dividing lines and splitting up some neighbourhoods that once shared representation. Cambridge is expanding from six to eight.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;People may not have found in the end that they live in the area that they were interested in in the past, so they may find that this doesn&#8217;t work as well as it would have with the smaller areas,&#8221; Williams said.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Cambridge, 11 out of the 24 candidates registered are running out of their home ward. In Waterloo, all 13 candidates for ward councillor are running in the ward where they live.<br \/>   <br \/>   Candidates have until September 10 to declare their candidacy.

My comment was simply reflective of me as a voter, not as a candidate.<br \/>   <br \/>   As you have eluded to in the past, the voters are really going to need to do their homework this election- particularly in wards that have 6 candidates.  I believe part of that homework is understanding why the candidate wants to be a city councillor, and determining how hard they are going to work on your behalf.  <br \/>   <br \/>   For many voters, the best indicators of how hard a candidate will work on your behalf are past city\/community involvement, and how hard they work during the campaign.<br \/>   <br \/>   You'll forgive me, but I believe a candidate who spends months engaging the people of the community (like you have) shows a greater committment to the community than someone who comes along a few weeks before voting day.","signature":"","date":"09-11-2010 09:58 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"62"},"14393":{"user":{"name":"Scott Davey","avatar":null,"title":"Junior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Sep 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Hello,<br \/>    <br \/>    I'm a candidate for councillor in Ward 1.

Second, thank you for wanting to make an informed vote.<br \/>   <br \/>     I live (and am running) in Ward 6, so I can't recommend any Ward specific questions.  However, I think there are a few questions the voters should ask all candidates, regardless of Ward.<br \/>   <br \/>   1) <b>What does a city councillor do?<\/b><br \/>       - I recommend this over the &quot;Why do you want to be a councillor?&quot; because all candidates will have an answer prepared for that.  Asking a candidate what a councillor does   gives you a good idea of how well they actually understand the job they claim to be qualified for.<br \/>   <br \/>   2)  <b>What qualifies you to be a councillor?\/What experience do you have representing the people of this community?<\/b><br \/>      - I lump these two together because often times the answers will overlap.  But feel free to ask both seperately.<br \/>   <br \/>   3) <b>Why are you running in this Ward?<\/b><br \/>      - This would be for any candidates that are running in Wards they don't live in.  Essentially what you want to know is how well they understand your community.  It's not about geography.  It's about their vested interest in the Ward; and their knowledge of the people, history, and challenges of the ward.<br \/>   <br \/>   4) <b>Ask &quot;How?&quot;<\/b><br \/>      - Every candidate running will tell you what they want to accomplish if elected, but unless they have an efficient and fiscally responsible way of accomplishing them- it is unlikely the other 9 councillors or the mayor will support it.  It also helps to seperate empty campaign promises from genuine goals.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>      These questions will help to show you how hard a candidate has and will work on your behalf, and also how equipt they are to do the job effectively.  They should also help you uncover which candidates are in touch with the issues that matter most to you.  <br \/>   <br \/>     I hope this helps.<br \/>   <br \/>   Jamie Vasey<br \/>   Candidate for City Council<br \/>   Ward 6- Kitchener","signature":"","date":"09-15-2010 08:56 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"73"},"14675":{"user":{"name":"Sandy MacFarlane","avatar":null,"title":"Junior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Sep 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation 112 Glasgow St.    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"I was biking through Victoria Park and Downtown Kitchener today (as I do everyday) and I was wondering why some candidates think it's ok to put up their signs on public property( i.e. boulevards, church property, street corners etc.) ?

He dismissed his challenger&#8217;s claims the township needs new ideas and leadership at the head of council.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I think we are proactive. Look at that new building (Woolwich Memorial Centre): we listened to the people. We listen to everyone.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I think we have a pretty good record to go on,&#8221; he said in an interview this week, reacting to remarks made by Elmira businessman Todd Cowan in announcing his candidacy.<br \/>   <br \/>   While prepared for an election, Strauss said he was surprised Cowan was making a bid for his job instead of running for a council seat.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I would like to see him run for council first and get some training, then run [for mayor] when I&#8217;m ready to step down.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   In response, Cowan said he decided to run for mayor rather than a council position because &#8220;we have to have change at the top &#8211; that&#8217;s where we need it most.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   In the face of growing challenges, Cowan said the township can no longer make do with reactive leadership dealing with issues strictly on a piecemeal basis.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We need to be proactive. We should have policies in place rather than waiting for things to happen then reacting with a lack of leadership.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   With the campaign for the Oct. 25 municipal election in the early stages, Strauss identified property taxes as a priority. Noting Woolwich taxes are second lowest in Waterloo Region, he said he hopes to keep them that way.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Dollars mean an awful lot to me &#8211; I was trained that way in business.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   He also points to a new Hwy. 7 corridor between Kitchener and Guelph as longstanding issue in need of resolution.<br \/>   <br \/>   Strauss expects to run a low-key campaign, highlighting his experience. <b><font color=\"Red\">He&#8217;s been mayor since 1997, contesting that year&#8217;s election and again in 2000.

I just thought it was interesting that a spammer on the other side of the world would feel the need to target someone running for council in New Hamburg.","signature":"","date":"10-18-2010 09:22 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"8"}}},"572":{"parent_forums":[{"forum_id":"11","forum_name":"Regional Economy and Politics"},{"forum_id":"13","forum_name":"Politics"},{"forum_id":"30","forum_name":"Municipal Election | October 25, 2010"}],"title":"Wellesley Election | Uncontested","description":"Wellesley Election 2010     Voting Day is October 25, 2010.        http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/election\/WellesleyTownshipHall.png        Candidates        Mayor | Ward 1 | Ward 2          Ross Kelterborn | Shelley Wagner | Herb Neher","keywords":["2010 municipal election","cambridge election","kitchener election","mayor","municipal politics","waterloo election","waterloo region election","ward","2010","wellesley","election","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/herb%20neher.pdf","neher","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/shelley%20wagner.pdf","wagner","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/ward%203-m.pdf","herb","hergott","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/paul%20hergott.pdf","http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/election\/wellesleywardboundaries2010.png","paul","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/jim%20olender.pdf","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/ward%204-m.pdf","shelley","olender","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/ward%202-m.pdf","october","http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/election\/wellesleytownshiphall.png","uncontested","voting","candidates","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/2010%20election-home.html","ross","kelterborn","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/ward1-m.pdf","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/township%20map%20-%20m.pdf","http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/ross%20kelterborn.pdf"],"canonical_url":null,"num_posts":"4","posts":{"10997":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919134136im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div align=\"center\"><b><font size=\"5\"><font color=\"blue\">Wellesley Election 2010 <\/font><\/font><br \/>   Voting Day is October 25, 2010.<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20100919134136im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/election\/WellesleyTownshipHall.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20100919134136\/http:\/\/www.township.wellesley.on.ca\/2010%20Election-home.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font size=\"3\"><font color=\"green\">Candidates<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   <table class=\"stg_table tborder\" style=\"width:800px;

The total number of municipal politicians in the region will grow by six to 57.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo residents and some others will be asked by referendum if they want to continue fluoridating drinking water.<br \/>    <br \/>    Pro-reform residents had called on politicians to merge some local councils in 2010, saying this would streamline municipal government. Their effort, launched in 2008, got little traction and politicians chose instead to tinker with the election.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed but we&#8217;re not discouraged,&#8221; said Jim Erb, spokesperson for the group Citizens for Better Government. He said he hopes candidates make reform a municipal election issue.<br \/>    <br \/>    Local mayors applaud the provincial government for advancing the election to the fourth Monday in October. It&#8217;s hoped this change will improve turnout.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The date will probably make it more convenient for people,&#8221; said Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, who has not decided whether to seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    The new date shortens the long municipal campaign by a few days, sets the election in potentially better weather, and gives local governments more time to prepare for the inauguration of new councils.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge council is expanding to nine members in the election. Kitchener council is expanding to 11. Proponents contend expansions will improve governance and spread the council workload around.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It will allow for a wider diversity of opinion on council, and of course representation,&#8221; said Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig, who is seeking re-election. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very good news for everybody.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;You have a chance of having more representation and more views on a subject, so that&#8217;s a good thing from a democratic standpoint,&#8221; Zehr said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Zehr expects the next Kitchener council will be mostly newcomers, as council opens up four new seats and some incumbents decline to see re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo council is staying at eight members. Regional council is staying at 16, including seven mayors. Four townships are staying at five members each.<br \/>    <br \/>    The municipal campaign formally launches Jan. 4, the first day candidates can register for office. They must register before they can raise money or spend it.<br \/>    <br \/>    Zehr and Craig want local politicians to debate municipal reform during the next council term. Regional Chair Ken Seiling doubts reform will happen until provincial politicians signal their interest in shaping it.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Clearly the province hasn&#8217;t shown an interest in touching municipal structures,&#8221; said Seiling, who has not announced if he will seek re-election.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ontario has made changes to financing rules for the municipal election. The province will also require more accessible voting places.","signature":"","date":"12-29-2009 12:09 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"11027":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919133343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=5cad6e6a15e964c61669743b5cc3cbed&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Candidates gear up for municipal elections<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    January 04, 2010<br \/>    By Melinda Dalton, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO REGION \u2014 Municipal elections may still be months away, but the race is on already in several communities across Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Monday marked the first official day candidates could register for the October elections in the three cities and the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    First out of the gate in Waterloo was Mayor Brenda Halloran, who registered her bid for a second term.<br \/>    <br \/>    Close behind was Waterloo Ward 6 Coun.

To be eligible to be on the ballot, you have to prove you live or own land in the city and are legally allowed to vote.<br \/>   <br \/>   Robert Williams, a retired political science professor from the University of Waterloo and municipal politics expert, said despite a widely held perception that a city councillor ought to live in the area they represent, it&#8217;s not necessarily a predictor of a successful or effective candidate.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It can be done by people who live elsewhere but can persuade the community that they are a good choice and they&#8217;re a legitimate voice,&#8221; he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s really about the candidate trying to sell himself or herself as an informed voice for some of the interests in the ward.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener Coun. John Gazzola, who has represented Ward 3 since he was elected in a 2002 byelection, does not live in that ward. He is the only sitting councillor who does not live in the ward he represents. His first race for the Ward 3 seat pitted him against eight other candidates, only three of whom lived in the area.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Gazzola&#8217;s case, Williams said, he sold himself as someone with a broad view of the interests of the municipality and a lot of experience, given his former position as the city&#8217;s chief administrative officer.<br \/>   <br \/>   It proved successful and he&#8217;s been re-elected twice in that same ward.<br \/>   <br \/>   In the 2006 election, seven out of 26 candidates in Kitchener ran outside of their wards of residence.<br \/>   <br \/>   Len Carter was one of those seven. He lived in Ward 3 but mounted an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Ward 2 council seat. He did so in part because he supported Gazzola and didn&#8217;t want to run against him.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It was about who I wanted to see on council,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t run a huge campaign, but I wanted (incumbent Berry Vrbanovic) to know that there was some opposition there.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Part of what could be contributing to this year&#8217;s ward-jumping could be the fact that the number of wards was expanded and each one now represents a smaller area, Williams said. Kitchener has moved from a six to 10 ward system, shifting around some of the dividing lines and splitting up some neighbourhoods that once shared representation. Cambridge is expanding from six to eight.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;People may not have found in the end that they live in the area that they were interested in in the past, so they may find that this doesn&#8217;t work as well as it would have with the smaller areas,&#8221; Williams said.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Cambridge, 11 out of the 24 candidates registered are running out of their home ward. In Waterloo, all 13 candidates for ward councillor are running in the ward where they live.<br \/>   <br \/>   Candidates have until September 10 to declare their candidacy. The municipal election takes place Oct. 25.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b><i>Where the candidates live:<\/i><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <b>CAMBRIDGE<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <u>WARD 1<\/u><br \/>   Donna Reid &#8211; lives in Ward 1<br \/>   Paulo Santos &#8211; lives in Ward 2<br \/>   Barbara Bierman &#8211; lives in Ward 2<br \/>   Sean McCafferty &#8211; lives in Ward 1<br \/>   Steve Halicki &#8211; lives in Ward 3<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>WARD 2<\/u><br \/>   Mark Fox &#8211; lives in Ward 2<br \/>   Rick Cowsill &#8211; lives in Ward 2<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>WARD 3<\/u><br \/>   Brian Santos &#8211; lives in Ward 4<br \/>   Karl Kiefer &#8211; lives in Ward 3<br \/>   Bev McDowell &#8211; lives in Ward 3<br \/>   Mike Toffner &#8211; lives in Ward 4<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>WARD 4<\/u><br \/>   Ben Tucci &#8211; lives in Ward 7<br \/>   Jan Liggett &#8211; lives in Ward 4<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>Ward 5<br \/>   <\/u>Pam Wolf &#8211; lives in Ward 5<br \/>   Rhonda MacDougall-Butcher &#8211; lives in Ward 4<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>Ward 6<\/u><br \/>   Gary Price &#8211; lives in Ward 6<br \/>   Thomas Vann &#8211; lives in Ward 1<br \/>   Shannon Adshade &#8211; lives in Ward 6<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>Ward 7<\/u><br \/>   Frank Curnew &#8211; lives in Ward 7<br \/>   Frank Monterio &#8211; lives in Ward 3<br \/>   <br \/>   <u>Ward 8<\/u><br \/>   Nicholas Ermeta &#8211; lives in Ward 8<br \/>   Susan Galvao &#8211; lives in Ward 3<br \/>   Bill Kirby &#8211; lives in Ward 5<br \/>   Gail Moorhouse &#8211; lives in Ward 8","signature":"","date":"08-03-2010 09:27 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"12"},"12076":{"user":{"name":"DHLawrence","avatar":null,"title":"Senior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 245","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Donna or Sean had better be interested in transit and urban development; I'm not going to vote for someone who doesn't actually represent my ward.","signature":"","date":"08-03-2010 06:06 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"13"},"13214":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919133343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=5cad6e6a15e964c61669743b5cc3cbed&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Who's there?<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   570 News Aug 25, 2010 03:32:22 AM<br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20100919133343\/http:\/\/www.570news.com\/radio\/570news\/article\/93219--who-s-there\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.570news.com\/radio\/570news...9--who-s-there<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   An analysis of events attended by municipal politicians shows some startling differences in the number of times each elected official turned up at a community event. It's no surprise that the mayors of Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo attend the most events on council but the number of events attended by different councillors can vary widely. The difference was most stark in Kitchener, where Councillor Berry Vrbanovic attended 114 community events last year, compared to just 6 attended by Councillor John Smola. Smola announced on Monday that he would be seeking a seat on regional council in the fall.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Cambridge, Councillor Linda Whetham shows the most 2009 dates booked on her calendar with 132, while Councillor Rick Cowsill recorded 45 events attended but says the actual number was much higher.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Waterloo, Councillor Jan d'Ailly attended 60 events in 2009 while Councillor Ian McLean attended 16.<br \/>   <br \/>   Both Whetham and d'Ailly, who attended the most events as councillors in their respective cities, have entered the mayoral race in October.<br \/>   <br \/>   Event attendance is not tracked for regional councillors although records show that Chair Ken Seiling attended more than 500 community events in 2009.<br \/>   <br \/>   In providing the information, each municipality noted that tracking attendance is an inexact science that does not take into account events councillors attend without recording it in their calendars. There are also the issues of neighbourhood meetings and attendance at formal commitments such as boards that do not get captured in the data. And attendance can also be influenced by a councillor's role as deputy mayor or by personal circumstances that prevent them from attending scheduled events.<br \/>   <br \/>   These theories are supported by Robert Williams, Professor Emeritus at the University of Waterloo, and an expert in municipal affairs. &quot;The dilemma becomes who's keeping track of it and what counts for it. (For example) does merely turning up for five minutes amount to the same thing as being there for a couple of hours? There are also different types of meetings that might be counted,&quot; Williams explains.<br \/>   <br \/>   Still, Williams believes the record does show a certain level of engagement, no matter how rudimentary. And he thinks that accounting can provide information for voters preparing to mark a ballot this October. &quot;Is this someone who has made the time and effort to go hear what's going on, to participate in what may be happening in a particular ward or a particular community centre or whatever it might be.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   For people seeking office, possibly for the first time, Williams says this type of information can also serve as an indicator of what comes with the office. &quot;Yes there are committees, yes there are liaison roles. But this is the other part of it, essentially being out there, interacting with the community.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   Events attended by members of council in 2009 were as follows:<br \/>   ...<br \/>   <b><u>CAMBRIDGE<\/u><\/b><br \/>   Mayor Doug Craig - 221<br \/>   Councillor Linda Whetham - 132<br \/>   Councillor Pam Wolf - 109<br \/>   Councillor Gary Price - approx. 100<br \/>   Councillor Karl Kiefer - 93<br \/>   Councillor Ben Tucci - 50<br \/>   Councillor Rick Cowsill -  45<br \/>   ...","signature":"","date":"08-25-2010 08:28 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"14"},"13402":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100919133343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=5cad6e6a15e964c61669743b5cc3cbed&amp;u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,672","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Mike Devine &amp; Joseph Gowing are now candidates in Ward 1.

When they decided to move all floors up by one, it saved some digging and water related considerations, but bringing the basement floor above ground meant that its square footage had to be calculated differently with respect to the parking requirements for the building. The developers argued that since it had been approved previously, and no change to the use was being made, merely to the elevation of each floor, that it should not be required to provide more parking, and I believe that this exception was granted.","signature":"Eventually, you can't go on not caring. <a href=\"\/web\/20110208222503\/http:\/\/viewfromthe42.wordpress.com\/\">You realize you

transform Highway 8 and Highway 401 around the Toyota car assembly plant over the next two decades.<br \/>    <br \/>    Provincial transportation officials intend to hire a consultant to investigate and propose:<ul><li>improvements to the Highway 8\/Sportsworld\/Maple Grove interchange at the Cambridge-Kitchener boundary<\/li>   <li>improvements to the Highway 8 interchange with Highway 401 at the Cambridge-Kitchener border<\/li>   <li>adding another interchange to Highway 401 in the area of Speedsville Road in Cambridge.<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    The environmental assessment study would include a session to gather public comment.<br \/>    <br \/>    Recommendations are expected by March, 2009.<br \/>    <br \/>    For Cambridge planning commissioner Janet Babcock, there is an obvious need to improve traffic flow in and around Highways 8 and 401. That's where industrial growth is going in Cambridge, with another city industrial park expected to open this year, on Boxwood Drive beside Toyota.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;They're probably trying to look at some kind of rationalization of all the traffic infrastructure,&quot; she said of the provincial study.<br \/>    <br \/>    Babcock wouldn't be surprised to see a plan that proposes a big flyover bridge to take traffic from Highway 8 southbound to Highway 401 westbound, giving Toyota better truck access to its new plant in Woodstock. The structure might look like the one that now carries Highway 8 traffic directly to the eastbound 401, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Today, trucks in the Cambridge business park around Toyota take Maple Grove Road to Sportsworld Drive to King Street before entering the 401.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;Certainly, anything is going to be an improvement going west, from what we have now,&quot; said Eugene Moser, president of Challenger Motor Freight.<br \/>    <br \/>    The company's headquarters and main terminal are about a kilometre east of the Sportsworld\/Maple Grove\/Highway 8 interchange.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;This is just a temporary solution right now, going and turning left on King,&quot; Moser said. &quot;I don't think anybody ever thought that would be the ultimate solution.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo Region and provincial roads officials first met to discuss traffic troubles in the Highway 8\/Sportsworld area in 2006. Businesses in the Cambridge Business Park want better access to the 401.<br \/>    <br \/>    Graham Vincent, director of transportation planning with the region, wouldn't speculate about what changes the study might spawn to improve traffic flow in north Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Babcock only learned of the provincial highway study when the Transportation Ministry objected to a housing subdivision plan along Limerick Road, south of the 401\/8 interchange.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ministry officials want to meet with their city and Waterloo Region counterparts in the next month or so to talk about the new highway study and how to allow the subdivision to proceed.<br \/>    <br \/>    Babcock is anxious for the meeting, because major road changes might force the city to change how it plans growth along and north of Highway 401. The city's official plan review is underway and must take such potential road changes into consideration.<br \/>    <br \/>    Already, city staff have delayed plans to repair bridges carrying Speedsville Road over the Speed River, from this year to 2010, because of the interchange study nearby on the 401.<br \/>    <br \/>    The ministry also wants 2.1 hectares of the former Sportsworld property in Kitchener &quot;protected for future interchange improvements&quot; as part of widening plans underway along Highway 8 south, out of Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    Babcock wants to find out how the highway access study fits into other provincial road plans and studies.<br \/>    <br \/>    She sees how the new study could knit separate highways together to better serve the district:<br \/>    <br \/>    Plans to widen Highway 401 to 10 lanes through are already well advanced<br \/>    <br \/>    Construction of a new Highway 7 between Kitchener and Guelph has been approved<br \/>    <br \/>    A new Highway 24 route, linking Cambridge and Brantford, is under study<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;When you start putting together the parts . . . there's a lot of work that being planned for this region,&quot; Babcock said.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100212052805\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=116\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 116\"><font color=\"Green\"><font size=\"2\"><b>Canadian Monopoly - Vote for Waterloo<\/b><\/font><\/font><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 01:43 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"285":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100212052805im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 537","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Planners rule out adding Highway 401 interchange at Speedsville Road<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    February 24, 2009 <br \/>    Jeff Outhit, RECORD STAFF - CAMBRIDGE<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100212052805\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/493025\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/493025<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100212052805im_\/http:\/\/media.therecord.topscms.com\/images\/d3\/9c\/b25236ed40f78e4c5808745dde02.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    Highway planners have ruled out adding a Highway 401 interchange at Speedsville Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    Such an interchange would damage Speed River wetlands, compromise traffic safety and worsen congestion, they contend.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It would be a hindrance, adding an interchange at Speedsville,&quot; said Scott Howard, project manager for the Ministry of Transportation. <br \/>    <br \/>    Instead, the ministry proposes better connections between Highway 401 and Highway 8, at an undefined cost exceeding $100 million. This proposal includes: <br \/>    <br \/>    Two highway-to-highway ramps that would soar above a <br \/>    <br \/>    reconfigured interchange at King Street. <br \/>    <br \/>    A reconfigured interchange at Sportsworld Drive and Highway 8.<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposal released yesterday is intended to improve Highway 401 access in south Kitchener and Cambridge. It has no launch date and is not among projects the province plans to construct within five years. <br \/>    <br \/>    The rejection of an interchange at Speedsville Road was both panned and praised by residents at a public information centre. <br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;I think they should have had one 20 years ago,&quot; Jim Cassel said. &quot;It's the industrial basin of the city.&quot; <br \/>    <br \/>    Steve Halicki also feels Speedsville Road needs an interchange. &quot;They've done this in Toronto,&quot; he said. &quot;Why could they do it in Toronto but they can't do it here?&quot; <br \/>    <br \/>    Mike Dearden and Larry Johnston say Speedsville is the wrong place for another interchange. &quot;It's too tight between Highway 24 and Highway 8 to put in another full <br \/>    <br \/>    interchange,&quot; Dearden said. <br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;I fully understand the mess it would create on the 401,&quot; Johnston said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Planners say Speedsville Road will get a new bridge over the 401 but not an interchange. They contend an interchange would: <br \/>    <br \/>    Impact Speed River wetlands.<br \/>    <br \/>    Increase traffic on Speedsville and Royal Oak roads. <br \/>    <br \/>    This is because, in a short space heading up a steep hill, vehicles entering the 401 from Speedsville would have to weave against vehicles exiting the 401 at Highway 8.<br \/>    <br \/>    Planners say this would &quot;create conflicts, congestion and compromise traffic safety.&quot; In peak hours they predict westbound traffic would back up almost to Hespeler Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    The ministry proposes instead to construct more flyover ramps where Highway 401 meets Highway 8.<br \/>    <br \/>    Motorists heading out of Kitchener on Highway 8 would take a new flyover to go west on Highway 401. This would get them off King Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    Motorists heading eastbound on Highway 401 would take a new flyover to enter Kitchener on Highway 8. This would get them off King Street. Interchanges at Sportsworld Drive and at King Street would be reconfigured to improve traffic flow.<br \/>    <br \/>    This would consume nine hectares, disrupting a corner of the Sportsworld Crossing shopping plaza in Kitchener and part of a proposed Limerick Drive subdivision in Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Affected developers are aware of highway plans.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">HIGHWAY 8 AND HIGHWAY 401 INTERCHANGE IMPROVEMENTS<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    DATE: March 31, 2009<br \/>    http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/790B281C9D0A0AC585257586005563E5\/$file\/P-09-032.pdf<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>RECOMMENDATION:<\/b><br \/>    THAT the Regional Municipality of Waterloo request the Ministry of Transportation to consider the recommendations contained in Report P-09-032, dated March 31, 2009, relating to the Class<br \/>    Environmental Assessment for the Highway 8 and Highway 401 Interchange, including:<blockquote>a) The Ministry of Transportation work with the Region through the Regional Transportation Master Plan process to consider establishing an additional interchange to Highway 401;<br \/>    b) Transit priority measures, such as queue jump lanes and signal priority, be recognized in the Transportation Environmental Study Report and included in the detailed design of the Highway 8 and Sportsworld Drive interchange to assist transit operations;<br \/>    c) Pedestrian improvements around the Highway 8 and Sportsworld Drive interchange be recognized in the Transportation Environmental Study Report and incorporated into the detailed design of the interchange in order to support planned public transit infrastructure; and<br \/>    d) The Ministry of Transportation recognize the need for bus bypass shoulder lanes along Highway 8 and Highway 401 within the study area in the Transportation Environmental Study Report, and work with the Region to explore the feasibility of these lanes during detailed design.<\/blockquote><br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Proposed highway interchange<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Ray Martin, Times Staff<br \/>    Oct 21, 2009 - 3:54 PM<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100212052805\/http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/local\/article\/156770--proposed-highway-interchange\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/lo...ay-interchange<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge residents have until the end of the month to make final comments on a plan that will overhaul the Highway 401\/8 interchange.<br \/>    <br \/>    Over the last year, Ministry of Transportation officials have been working with consultants, city and regional staff on the environmental assessment (EA) study for the stretch of Highway 401 between the Speed and Grand rivers, and up Highway 8 to the interchange at Sportsworld Drive.<br \/>    <br \/>    The recently completed study is the latest step towards revamping and upgrading the interchange to meet the growing volume of traffic heading into and out of Kitchener through Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    MTO public relations spokesperson Christina Martin told the Times the ongoing widening of Highway 8 north, off Sportsworld Drive, &#8220;was taken into account in the Highway 8\/Highway 401 interchange improvement study&#8221;, however, &#8220;further EA work will be required as part of the future design process and before any construction could occur&#8221; at the Highway 401\/8 interchange.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;These improvements are not part of the southern highways program, the ministry&#8217;s five-year construction program,&#8221; she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Working from east to west, the plan proposes to extend the existing bridge over Highway 401 at Speedsville Road and replace the Fountain Street bridge. A three-metre sound barrier would be installed from the Fountain Street bridge on the south side to the end of the eastbound on-ramp at the top of Shantz Hill Road. The Highway 401 off-ramp onto old King Street would also be reworked and a stoplight would be erected at the foot of the ramp.<br \/>    <br \/>    Meanwhile, the Highway 401 off-ramp would be extended west across the Grand River on a new bridge. Along that new off-ramp, planners have designed another ramp leading to a two-lane flyover, which will allow eastbound traffic to pass over Highway 401 and onto the northbound Highway 8 near Sportsworld Drive.<br \/>    <br \/>    At Sportsworld Drive, MTO officials are proposing to revamp the interchange, widening the bridge to accommodate more lanes of traffic and designing a new off-ramp for northbound traffic. They would also widen the Highway 401 overpass at King Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    For southbound traffic heading to London off Highway 8, the MTO plan proposes a new two-lane ramp and a bridge crossing old King Street to Highway 401.<br \/>    <br \/>    Also being proposed is high-mast lighting to better illuminate the interchange. Highway 8, between Sportsworld Drive and Highway 401, will be widened to six lanes, while Highway 401 is widened to eight lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    Currently, 95,000 vehicles annually use Highway 8 and that volume is anticipated to increase to 115,000 by 2021. Meanwhile, traffic volumes on Highway 401 at the interchange will increase from 130,000 vehicles annually to 175,000 by 2021.<br \/>    <br \/>    At this point, no funding has been allocated to the project. <br \/>    <br \/>    For comments or questions about the study, contact project manager Scott Howard at the Ministry of Transportation, 659 Exeter Rd., London, Ont., N6E 1L3, <a href=\"mailto:scott.howard@ontario.ca\">scott.howard@ontario.ca<\/a>, or call 1-800-265-6072, or consultant project manager Gregg Cooke a Stantec Consulting Ltd. 1400 Rymal Rd.

Residents have until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 12 to remove their parked cars from city streets or risk receiving an $80 ticket and being towed at the owner's expense. The parking ban will remain in affect for 24 hours - until 11:59 p.m. Thursday, Jan. 13. Notification will be given in advance of that time as to whether or not the city will cancel the snow event or extend it for another 24 hours. That decision will be made based on weather conditions and credible forecasts. <br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Tag-and-Tow Bylaw<\/b><br \/>   To help city crews clear all streets of snow within 24 hours of the storm ending, under the city's \"tag-and-tow\" bylaw residents are prohibited from parking their cars on city streets at any time when a snow event has been declared by the city. Snow events are declared when the city anticipates a significant amount of snow to accumulate. Residents should tune into local media for updates, or visit <a href=\"\/web\/20120514030323\/http:\/\/kitchener.ca\/en\/insidecityhall\/Tag_tow_bylaw.asp\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/kitchener.ca\/en\/insidecityhall\/Tag_tow_bylaw.asp<\/a> to join the city's snow event email distribution list. Members of that email distribution list will receive a direct email when the city declares future snow events and when snow events are extended or declared over. Residents who suspect their car has been towed should call 519-741-2330 to find out where their car has been relocated. <br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Enforcement of the Tag-and-Tow Bylaw<\/b><br \/>   During snow events, City of Kitchener bylaw enforcement staff will be asked to attend locations where parked vehicles are impeding snow-removal equipment from clearing the street. Enforcement staff will assess the situation and may ticket and tow some of the vehicles on the street to help the plows remove snow from that street. Vehicles will not be ticketed and towed based on calls from the public. Enforcement will only tow the number of vehicles necessary to allow the snow-removal equipment to do its job. It is possible that only a certain number of vehicles on a street will be removed, regardless of how many are actually present and in violation of the bylaw. In the event that some, but not all, vehicles are towed away, the remaining vehicles found in violation will be ticketed.","signature":"","date":"01-12-2011 07:56 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"6"},"24553":{"user":{"name":"ViewFromThe42","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Dec 2010","num_posts":"63"}},"content":"It seems as though everything is closed today.

Residents have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, Feb. 1, 2011 to remove their parked cars from city streets or risk receiving an $80 ticket and being towed at the owner's expense. The parking ban will remain in affect for 24 hours - until 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 2, 2011. <br \/>    <br \/>    Notification will be given in advance of that time as to whether or not the city will cancel the snow event or extend it for another 24 hours. That decision will be made based on weather conditions and credible forecasts. <br \/>    <br \/>    <u>Tag-and-Tow Bylaw<\/u><br \/>    To help city crews clear all streets of snow within 24 hours of the storm ending, under the city's \"tag-and-tow\" bylaw residents are prohibited from parking their cars on city streets at any time when a snow event has been declared by the city. Snow events are declared when the city anticipates a significant amount of snow to accumulate.<br \/>    Residents should tune into local media for updates, or visit <a href=\"\/web\/20110209235054\/http:\/\/www.kitchener.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.kitchener.ca<\/a> to join the city's snow event email distribution list. Members of that email distribution list will receive a direct email when the city declares future snow events and when snow events are extended or declared over. <br \/>    Residents who suspect their car has been towed should call 519-741-2330 to find out where their car has been relocated. <br \/>    <br \/>    <u>Enforcement of the Tag-and-Tow Bylaw<\/u><br \/>    During snow events, City of Kitchener bylaw enforcement staff will be asked to attend locations where parked vehicles are impeding snow-removal equipment from clearing the street. Enforcement staff will assess the situation and may ticket and tow some of the vehicles on the street to help the plows remove snow from that street. <br \/>    Vehicles will not be ticketed and towed based on calls from the public. <br \/>    Enforcement will only tow the number of vehicles necessary to allow the snow-removal equipment to do its job. It is possible that only a certain number of vehicles on a street will be removed, regardless of how many are actually present and in violation of the bylaw. In the event that some, but not all, vehicles are towed away, the remaining vehicles found in violation will be ticketed. <br \/>    Vehicles will be ticketed and relocated to another area in close proximity when it is possible and practical to do so. Vehicles will be towed at the owners' expense.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209235054\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-01-2011 12:50 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"24457":{"user":{"name":"HillDweller","avatar":null,"title":"Hamlet Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Dec 2010","num_posts":"8"}},"content":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209235054\/http:\/\/www.intellicast.com\/National\/Radar\/Current.aspx?location=default&amp;region=CAD&amp;animate=true\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.intellicast.com\/National\/...D&amp;animate=true<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    You can zero in to the local area.","signature":"","date":"02-01-2011 01:13 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"24472":{"user":{"name":"Waterlooer","avatar":"\/web\/20110209235054im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=284&amp;dateline=1288713241","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"502"}},"content":"People in Oklahoma got blasted with snow last night, here is a pic of the storm someone sent in from Oklahoma: (from: <a href=\"\/web\/20110209235054\/http:\/\/vortex.accuweather.com\/adc2004\/pub\/includes\/columns\/newsstory\/2011\/300x225_02011829_claremoreok.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/vortex.accuweather.com\/adc200...laremoreok.jpg<\/a>)<br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20110209235054im_\/http:\/\/vortex.accuweather.com\/adc2004\/pub\/includes\/columns\/newsstory\/2011\/300x225_02011829_claremoreok.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<i>Home Sweet Region...<\/i><b>Waterloo<\/b>","date":"02-01-2011 02:20 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"6"},"24473":{"user":{"name":"IEFBR14","avatar":"\/web\/20110209235054im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=177&amp;dateline=1283110420","title":"Transportation Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"H2OWC","member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"973"}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110209235054im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>Waterlooer<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110209235054\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=24472#post24472\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110209235054im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">People in Oklahoma got blasted with snow last night<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     A 23cm snow fall, as is being reported, is unusual in OK.

The long-span girder bridge would cost about $28 million, including roadwork.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    Plans are back on track to build a new bridge over the Grand River by 2010, linking Kitchener to Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo regional councillors had stalled bridge plans for a year, to consult with Six Nations aboriginals who have claimed the Grand River. Yesterday, they agreed to move forward again, voting to hire a consultant to design the bridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Construction would take place in 2009 and 2010. The project, linking Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge, is now expected to cost $28 million, including road extensions.<br \/>    <br \/>    It will be the first new bridge over the Grand in this region since 1963.<br \/>    <br \/>    Councillors expect it will help ease traffic congestion in south Kitchener while improving connections between Kitchener, Cambridge and Guelph.<br \/>    <br \/>    By proceeding with a $28-million budget, councillors have effectively ruled out a showcase bridge featuring a bowstring arch.<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed bowstring design, reflecting historic bridges in the region, was on a short list of three designs presented to the public last year. It would have cost an extra $8 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    Instead, council intends to build a basic, long-span girder bridge, with piers kept out of the river, Regional Chair Ken Seiling said. \"In an ideal world, if money was no object, we could go with something more. I think we have to have a reasonable design.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr also favours the more basic design.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I support it because it's a balance of esthetics and cost,\" Zehr said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Jean Haalboom had pressed for a fancier design but did not object yesterday.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"A decision has been made,\" she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Councillors said they hope other design elements will be incorporated into the bridge to improve its appearance.<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed bridge is moving forward again now that regional officials have consulted with rival aboriginal councils that both claim to speak for the Six Nations people.<br \/>    <br \/>    One is an elected council. The other is a traditional council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Chiefs from both councils are involved in negotiations to resolve the aboriginal occupation of contested lands at Caledonia.<br \/>    <br \/>    Six Nations aboriginals claim they never let go of the bed and banks of the Grand River, after they were granted lands along the river in 1784.<br \/>    <br \/>    Their claim to the river has not been accepted by senior governments.<br \/>    <br \/>    However, the Supreme Court has ruled that governments must consult with aboriginals about projects that may affect their claims.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We're going to move forward (on the bridge) in conjunction with ongoing consultations,\" Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It's an ongoing process. That's the best I can describe it.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Six Nations officials could not be reached for comment yesterday.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional chief administrator Mike Murray attended a meeting with traditional chiefs in January, held at a longhouse on the reserve south of Brantford.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"As a starting point, it was good,\" he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Several dozen Six Nations people attended, Murray said.<br \/>    <br \/>    He said the region was not asked to abandon or stall bridge plans. \"They had questions. They had comments,\" Murray said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Officials tried to answer their questions.<br \/>    <br \/>    Murray said aboriginals raised their claim to ownership of the Grand. They were told this is to be resolved between the Six Nations and the federal and provincial governments.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Our comment was, 'We wish you well, in the negotiations that you're directly involved with,'\" Murray said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional officials had previously discussed the bridge plans with the elected Six Nations government.<br \/>    <br \/>    <u><b>BRIDGE<\/b><\/u><br \/>    Last year, The Record invited readers to pick a design for a new bridge over the Grand River.

They will plead for a bowstring arch that could cost an extra $8 million, but reflects historic bridges built here in the 1920s and 1930s.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I'm not against practicality. But what I'm against is buying a plain-Jane car and hanging trinkets on it,\" said Glen Woolner, a Kitchener housing consultant and heritage proponent.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"What I want to see is something that serves the purpose, does everything that they want to see it do, but has something that is recognizable at a glance, that sticks in your head.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"And that's what our bowstring bridges do. They are prominent. They are memorable.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Jean Haalboom of Kitchener favours spending more for a bowstring bridge with showcase appeal.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We talk about urban design. We're talking about tourism, and spending millions of dollars on tourism,\" she said. \"We need to pay attention to our streetscapes and the entrances to our city.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Other councillors are unwilling to spend more on a design that's not needed to get people across the river.<br \/>    <br \/>    The bridge as proposed is affordable and \"architecturally pleasing,\" regional Chair Ken Seiling said. Plans call for enhancing its basic design with landscaping, lighting and other features.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think the public by and large said that they sort of like the middle of the road approach,\" Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The bridge, to be completed by 2010, will link Fairway Road in Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge. It's estimated to cost at least $28 million, including road work.<br \/>    <br \/>    Public reaction has favoured a flat, basic bridge. A public meeting last year drew 56 per cent in favour of the proposed design. A bowstring design found 31 per cent support.<br \/>    <br \/>    A Record survey last year found 44 per cent support for the proposed design and 20 per cent support for a bowstring arch.<br \/>    <br \/>    This will be the first new bridge over the Grand River in Waterloo Region since 1963.

This may involve landscaping, lighting, textured concrete or other elements.<br \/>    <br \/>    Strickland suggested adding a bowstring arch as a cheaper decorative feature, rather than as a costly structural element.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think it's important that we don't underestimate the importance a bridge can have on the psyche of a community,\" he said, citing the Brooklyn Bridge in New York and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.<br \/>    <br \/>    Staff warned that a decorative arch might not be feasible because its weight may require making it part of the bridge structure.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig hopes the approved bridge can be given a \"21st century\" look. He sees no point in echoing bowstring bridges.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think we make our own history,\" Craig said. \"I think the look has to be a statement of where we are, not what we were.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Region Chair Ken Seiling agrees. Bowstring bridges were the modern bridges of the 1920s, he said. \"We shouldn't be afraid to build a modern bridge today.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Jean Haalboom of Kitchener was the lone dissenter in favour of a bowstring bridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Bridges can form our identity, give us a sense of place,\" she said. \"They are the symbols that act as branding.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Haalboom fears the approved bridge may be dressed up with little more than checkerboard pillars, a regional crest \"and that's all we can afford.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Len Carter, a former municipal candidate, urged councillors to endorse a bowstring design.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"A plain-Jane, nondescript bridge will barely register,\" he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"If we don't make it memorable, it's going to be forgettable.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    It's estimated the bridge project will cost $28 million, including roadwork.

This would still leave off-road lanes for cyclists and a pedestrian sidewalk.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some councillors said they can support the bridge with all its proposed features because they will help attract hikers and cyclists to the river.<br \/>    <br \/>    The vote to name the road over the bridge was testy. Three Cambridge councillors asked that Kossuth Road be extended to the bridge on the Cambridge side, while Fairway would be extended to the bridge on the Kitchener side.<br \/>    <br \/>    However, most councillors said changing the road name at the bridge would puzzle drivers. \"Let's do something right for the travelling public, for a change,\" said Coun. Jim Wideman of Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    Instead, Fairway Road will be extended across the bridge to the intersection with Fountain Street in Cambridge. That's where Fairway will end and Kossuth will begin.<br \/>    <br \/>    The decision disappointed Greg Michalenko, a university professor who advocated extending Kossuth Road toward Kitchener. The road is named after a legendary 19th-century Hungarian patriot. Michalenko sees it as a livelier name than meaningless Fairway. \"Planners are so cautious, and sort of dull about this. They should show more spark.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Bridge over Grand is worth the money<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    January 30, 2008 <br \/>    THE RECORD<br \/>    <br \/>    Driving the main roads of Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo isn't as easy as it once was, and it's only going to become harder in the years ahead. There is a simple reason for this: growth. With Waterloo Region becoming a booming community during the past few decades, there are more vehicles on the roads than ever, which means drivers may become more frustrated than ever.<br \/>    <br \/>    One addition to Waterloo Region's road system that would help would be another bridge across the Grand River. The region hasn't built a bridge across the Grand since 1963.<br \/>    <br \/>    Recently, a bridge that would link Fairway Road in Kitchener with Kossuth Road in Cambridge has existed in the minds of regional transportation planners. The region has been gradually moving closer to a decision on the structure. The latest estimate is that the bridge will cost $55 million, which is far higher than the estimate made in 2006 that the bridge would cost $23 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are, however, good reasons for the extra cost. First, construction costs have risen. This should not be surprising in a booming market. Secondly, the latest estimate includes the construction of four lanes, compared to only two in the original plan. The additional two lanes will cost an extra $8 million. The region may not need four lanes for the present amount of traffic, but planners expect the traffic flow will need four lanes by 2021.<br \/>    <br \/>    That year isn't that far away, and it will be even closer by the time the bridge, in any form, is actually built. Constructing only two lanes now, therefore, would be false economy. The cost to the region in the future of constructing an extra two lanes would be greater than the cost of doing the entire project now.<br \/>    <br \/>    The harder question relates to what might be called the esthetic additions to the bridge. Planners have suggested options such as lookouts on both sides of the bridge and pedestrian level lighting.<br \/>    <br \/>    The esthetic issue is harder to deal with because it is subjective. A person who appreciates attractive structures would probably think the extra money is worth spending; a person who has only utilitarian values would disagree.<br \/>    <br \/>    What can be said is that this bridge is being built for the long run. From the long-term perspective, spending a little extra money now is both appropriate and wise. After all, it isn't every day -- or even decade -- that this region puts a bridge across the Grand.","signature":"","date":"01-03-2010 02:31 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"3"},"294":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120724004343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=c1a52c67f90c6bff91e2f4520cbde799&amp;u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5005"}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Region revisits Grand River bridge plans<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <b>Despite rising costs, regional chair says cutbacks 'wrong approach'<\/b><br \/>    February 06, 2008 <br \/>    JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional council could slash more than $13 million in soaring costs by going back to basics with a new bridge and road over the Grand River.<br \/>    <br \/>    Savings could come from narrowing the project to two lanes, abandoning pretty design features and forgoing sidewalk and cycling features, according to estimates in a new report.<br \/>    <br \/>    But slashing costs would be the wrong approach, regional Chair Ken Seiling says.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"This is probably the most highly visible and important piece of infrastructure we have done for awhile,\" Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It's one that people will look at, and if we don't do it right, I think there will be a lot of finger-pointing.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I personally don't see us pulling back on it.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    The road and bridge, almost two kilometres in total, will link Fairway Road in south Kitchener to Kossuth Road in north Cambridge.

Sean Strickland of Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>    In a recorded 13-to-1 vote, council approved the bridge's design with one minor variation. It will be 60 centimetres narrower for a $500,000 savings, bringing the estimated cost to $54.5 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional Chair Ken Seiling said the narrower design will not compromise any future plans to have a light-rail transit line across the bridge. It should also permit bicycle paths and sidewalks.<br \/>    <br \/>    The vote came after much debate about ways to reduce the cost of the project which had nearly doubled in two years.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr led the charge by suggesting five design changes for a total savings of $3.2 million. Some of his suggestions included removing the lookouts, a second sidewalk and a bicycle path and redesigning the bridge's piers.<br \/>    <br \/>    In the end, council only agreed to narrowing the bridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think this is nickel and diming,\" Coun.

She also opposed it because the bridge's design doesn't include a symbol of the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    Both Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig and Coun. Jake Smola of Kitchener said the bridge's cost estimate of $54.5 million should be a firm number, and if tenders come in higher, council should revisit the whole issue.","signature":"","date":"01-03-2010 02:32 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"4059":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120724004343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=c1a52c67f90c6bff91e2f4520cbde799&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4257"}},"content":"According to the <a href=\"\/web\/20120724004343\/http:\/\/www.kitchener.ca\/pdf\/yourkitnews_2010_mar_apr.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Your Kitchener Newsletter (March\/April Edition page 2)<\/a> the bridge construction will get underway this summer.","signature":"","date":"04-07-2010 01:20 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"5672":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120724004343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=c1a52c67f90c6bff91e2f4520cbde799&amp;u=99&amp;dateline=1266346234","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener, Ontario","member_since":"Feb 2010","num_posts":"953"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000ff\">TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT FOR 2010 ROAD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <b>REGION OF WATERLOO TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES: Design and Construction<\/b><br \/>   TO: Chair Jim Wideman and Members of the Planning and Works Committee<br \/>   DATE: April 27, 2010 <br \/>   Report: <a href=\"\/web\/20120724004343\/http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/66C2C3E2820B34638525770E0055FB98\/$file\/E-10-046.pdf?openelement\" target=\"_blank\"><font color=\"#417394\">E-10-046<\/font><\/a><br \/>    <br \/>   <b><font color=\"#0000ff\">APPENDIX A-1: 2010 Construction on Major Roads in the City of Kitchener<\/font><\/b><br \/>   Project | Managed By | Limits | Traffic Restrictions | Timing<br \/>   Fairway Road Extension and Bridge over the Grand River | Region | Zeller Drive to Fountain Street | New Road | Summer 2010 to Fall 2012<br \/>    <br \/>   <b><font color=\"#0000ff\">APPENDIX A-3: 2010 Construction on Major Roads in the City of Cambridge<br \/>   <\/font><\/b>Project | Managed By | Limits | Traffic Restrictions | Timing<br \/>   Fairway Road Extension and Bridge over the Grand River | Region | Zeller Drive to Fountain Street | New Road | Summer 2010 to Fall 2012","signature":"&quot;Only the insane have the strength enough to prosper.

Today, two new bridges are on the go.<br \/>   <br \/>   Construction is underway on a four-lane Highway 8 bridge over the Grand, a twin to the current bridge. It will widen the highway to eight lanes and is part of a three-year project costing $70 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   Construction will launch this summer on a four-lane Fairway Road bridge linking Kitchener to Kossuth Road in Cambridge. It&#8217;s planned to open in 2012 as part of a $55-million project.<br \/>   <br \/>   The twin Highway 8 bridge is long overdue. The Fairway Road bridge will provide new access to Kitchener and a new connection to Guelph via Kossuth Road. Both spans are needed, to help ease chronic congestion in south-east Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   However, Coun. Sean Strickland is dismayed Ontario didn&#8217;t design a prettier Highway 8 bridge, to play up the historic river. &#8220;Bridges make statements,&#8221; he contends. &#8220;Bridges are iconic and define communities.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Strickland, of Waterloo, had expected local planners to press the Ministry of Transportation for something special on Highway 8. But it turns out the twin bridge will be a replica of the current plain bridge. That&#8217;s an opportunity missed, he says.<br \/>   <br \/>   Ministry spokesperson Bob Nichols points to the &#8220;graceful arch&#8221; of its steel girders but also notes &#8220;these features will not be visible from the highway.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   By contrast, Waterloo regional council intends to make the Fairway Road bridge better-looking in views from above and below.<br \/>   <br \/>   It will not have a bowstring arch, to the dismay of some residents. But council-approved plans call for sculpted piers, lookouts on the Cambridge side, a gateway portal in Kitchener, pedestrian lookouts on the bridge, and an open exterior railing.<br \/>   <br \/>   The bridge will include cycling paths and sidewalks. It may eventually include decorative pedestrian lighting, connections to the trail beneath the bridge, and poles and banners for the centre median. Total costs for all design elements could reach $2 to $3 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   Council could still trim some of these features, if the cost to build the bridge and extend Fairway Road is deemed too high. Council is expected to confirm a construction tender May 26.<br \/>   <br \/>   This will be a prominent bridge in a scenic location, spanning an important river. It&#8217;s meant to last a century or more.

The bridge is expected to open to traffic Oct. 31, 2012.<br \/>    <br \/>    It&#8217;s the first brand-new span over the Grand in this community since 1963. The province is currently twinning its bridge over the Grand at Highway 7\/8. <br \/>    <br \/>    The bridge was delayed in part for consultations with Six Nations leaders. The aboriginal nation near Brantford claims to own the bed and banks of the Grand. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We believe we&#8217;ve done everything necessary along that front,&#8221; Seiling said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Project costs were estimated at just $23 million in 2006. Construction inflation, widening to four lanes, and design elements swelled estimates to $57 million, prior to the low bid. Budgeted funds not spent on the project will be redirected to other projects.<br \/>    <br \/>    A regional report says construction firms bid lower than expected because they&#8217;re looking for big projects after economic stimulus funding ends in 2011, and because the project is being built on green fields where staging is easy and there&#8217;s little traffic to disrupt. <br \/>    <br \/>    The recommended low bidder is an experienced Toronto firm, Grascan Construction. Local firm Steed and Evans has been subcontracted for road work. Six firms bid on the project. <br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:jouthit@therecord.com\">jouthit@therecord.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"08-17-2010 10:18 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"13"},"13083":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120724004343im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=c1a52c67f90c6bff91e2f4520cbde799&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4257"}},"content":"<a href=\"\/web\/20120724004343\/http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/44da53c85a3380618525779a00556bbc!OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Regional Council - August 19, 2010 Minutes<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   <b>FINANCE REPORTS<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120724004343\/http:\/\/www.region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/DB9DB634EDA5F2DC8525777E0060DD42\/$file\/F-10-072.pdf?openelement\" target=\"_blank\">F-10-072<\/a>, T2010-016 Fairway Road Extension, From Pebble Creek Drive (400 Metres West of Zeller Drive) to Fountain Street and Kossuth Road, Cities of Kitchener and Cambridge<br \/>   <br \/>   J.

Communities thrive or falter, based on how effectively people and products can get from A to B.<br \/>    <br \/>    Transportation reviews are often conducted every 15 years. A study done here in 1984 was followed by one completed in 1999.<br \/>    <br \/>    But the pace of change is faster now. The last review is already outdated.<br \/>    <br \/>    The 1999 plan looked to 2016. It concluded that the car is king here, that this is not going to change soon, and that trying to force drivers from their cars, by not building more roads, would not work.<br \/>    <br \/>    Accordingly, it recommended:<br \/>    <ul><li>Various road expansions.<\/li>   <li>Doubling the number of people taking transit, riding bicycles and walking, in order to limit automobile growth to 32 per cent. Otherwise, traffic would soar 43 per cent.<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    This was a sensible plan and it's been working.<br \/>    <br \/>    Road upgrades have been completed or are underway, to handle increasing traffic. Transit ridership is on track to double by 2016.<br \/>    <br \/>    So what's changed in just eight years, and why do we need to look at this again?<br \/>    <br \/>    The underlying premise is still sound. The car still rules.<br \/>    <br \/>    We own more cars than people in most Canadian cities and we drive them more often. Looking to 2031, people will not accept a plan that ends road-building.<br \/>    <br \/>    However:<br \/>    <ul><li>There's a heightened awareness that driving damages the environment, in particular air quality.<\/li>   <li>There's new interest in rapid transit, which is being studied after being ruled out as premature in 1999.<\/li>   <li>There's a stronger recognition that how we get around has an impact on how we use land, which in turn shapes our quality of life.<\/li>   <li>Senior governments have started funding roads and transit again, and the province has ordered the region to become more compact.<\/li>   <li>The takeover of public transit by regional government, in 2000, opens the door to a more co-ordinated and vigorous transit expansion.<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    The latest transportation review, launched last Thursday at a splashy public event, is expected to conclude in 2009. You can find details at <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.movingforward2031.ca<\/a>.<br \/>    <br \/>    What's likely to emerge is a measured road expansion, plus a stronger push to make public transit faster and more convenient, to lure more drivers from their cars.<br \/>    <br \/>    This will be expensive. But more people will choose transit if it meets their transportation needs.<br \/>    <br \/>    The wrong approach would be to stop building roads, force more gridlock, and lecture drivers about how they're killing the planet.<br \/>    <br \/>    People don't deserve to be hectored about how they choose to get around. They deserve better options.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 03:16 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 03:24 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"4"},"307":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=fb7af83c525021d69d88304ee2ede3ef&amp;u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">In the region, car is king, but that should change<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    February 09, 2008 <br \/>    JEFF OUTHIT, RECORD STAFF<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/306819\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/306819<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Luring residents from their cars is a worthy goal.

The reality is they always come first, because the car is king.<br \/>    <br \/>    The latest proof comes in a new study by Statistics Canada. It found 81 per cent of local adults travelled by car for every trip they made, on a day in 2005 when their travel habits were recorded.<br \/>    <br \/>    This is one of the highest driving rates in Canada.<br \/>    <br \/>    Among eight bigger cities, the closest was Edmonton, where 77 per cent drove everywhere.<br \/>    <br \/>    In eight mid-sized cities that are more our size, 75 per cent drove everywhere, on average. This group includes Hamilton, London, and Windsor.<br \/>    <br \/>    Statistics Canada has also found that in 2006, 86 per cent of local households owned or leased a motor vehicle.<br \/>    <br \/>    This is the highest ownership rate in Ontario, matched by Windsor and St. Catharines.<br \/>    <br \/>    In only three Canadian cities are residents more likely to have cars: Saskatoon, Abbotsford B.C., and Gatineau Que., which is near Ottawa.<br \/>    <br \/>    Why are we so addicted to driving?<br \/>    <br \/>    Many local residents live in suburban neighbourhoods, where homes are segregated from faraway jobs and shops. People can't reasonably walk or cycle to work or to the store.<br \/>    <br \/>    Buses are just too infrequent to be useful.<br \/>    <br \/>    This is partly because the community is too sprawling to support an efficient transit system.<br \/>    <br \/>    Also, getting around by car remains fairly easy. People gripe about traffic, but this community is not plagued by widespread congestion.<br \/>    <br \/>    Rather, it has pockets of congestion in Cambridge, where the road network is underbuilt, and it has a few bottlenecks in Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ontario benchmarks show local roads carry fewer cars than many comparable Ontario cities, including Windsor, Hamilton, London, Mississauga, Thunder Bay, Toronto and York.<br \/>    <br \/>    Looking ahead to 2031, let's hope reasonable ways can be proposed to get people out of their cars.<br \/>    <br \/>    For more information on the upcoming workshops go to <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.movingforward2031.ca<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    But remember, Waterloo Region residents drive everywhere, almost all the time, more than almost anybody else in Canada.<br \/>    <br \/>    It's wishful thinking to expect them to stop any time soon.<br \/>    <br \/>    Road Ahead is a weekly column on traffic and transportation issues.

These events are specifically designed to gain feedback on the proposed study direction for transit ridership targets, future preliminary transportation alternative networks, along with the proposed evaluation criteria.<br \/>    <br \/>    There have been several public events to confirm our workplan and major goals and objectives to guide the development of the remainder of the plan. A future preliminary network analysis shows that, without further enhancements to our transit system, at least 100 additional lanes of traffic will be required, which would be equivalent to 16 six-lane arterials (similar to Hespeler and Fairway Roads) to accommodate our future travel demands. This amount of road construction is impractical for the following reasons:<br \/>    <ul><li>Construction, rehabilitation, maintenance and land costs would be extensive;<\/li>   <li>A limited ability to widen or build new roads within narrow existing road allowances;<\/li>   <li>Social impacts, including neighbourhood division by wider roads;<\/li>   <li>Impacts on the natural environment and cultural heritage resources;<\/li>   <li>Impacts on health by decreasing air quality and discouraging active travel, including cycling and walking;<\/li>   <li>Large amounts of valuable land would be needed for widening and building new roads; and,<\/li>   <li>Extensive road construction that encourages outward growth.<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    Therefore, the Regional Transportation Master Plan is proposing a more focused transit oriented network with strategic road improvements, while encouraging more cycling and walking. It is recognized that the automobile will continue to be a prominent mode of travel and this approach will not eliminate the need for road improvements, but will reduce the amount of road construction required to about 34 lanes to accommodate future travel demands. Several preliminary alternative networks have been developed along with a set of evaluation criteria to assess the effectiveness of each network. A series of workshops are planned to gain public input on these preliminary alternatives and evaluation criteria. The workshops will be held on June 9, 11, and 16, from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. in Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo, respectively. Notifications of these workshops have been placed in all local newspapers. Input received from these events will be key when continuing the development and assessment of our preliminary alternative transportation networks.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 03:29 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"6"},"309":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=fb7af83c525021d69d88304ee2ede3ef&amp;u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Public Workshop #3 <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/consult_pw3.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/consult_pw3.htm<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Public Workshop #3 will be held on:<br \/>    <ul><li>Tuesday, June 9, 2009 (Cambridge)<\/li>   <li>Thursday, June 11, 2009 (Kitchener)<\/li>   <li>Tuesday, June 16, 2009 (Waterloo)<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    For more information see Public Workshop Notice<br \/>    <ul><li><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/downloads\/ROW-RTMP_Record1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Workshop #3 Notice<\/a><\/li>   <li><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/downloads\/Workshop3pdf\/Workshop3_Comment_Sheet_June2009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Workshop #3 Comment Sheet <\/a><\/li>   <li><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/downloads\/Workshop3pdf\/WORKSHOP_3_GOALS&amp;OBJECTIVES_JUNE_2009.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Public Workshop #3 Goals &amp; Objectives<\/a><\/li>   <li><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/downloads\/Workshop3pdf\/Workshop3_%20Presentation_June2009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Workshop #3 Presentation<\/a><\/li>   <li><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/downloads\/Workshop3pdf\/WORKSHOP_3_BOOKLET_JUNE_2009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Public Workshop #3 Booklet<\/a><\/li>   <\/ul>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 03:48 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"4295":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=fb7af83c525021d69d88304ee2ede3ef&amp;u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 447","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u>Big plan, big costs, big questions <\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    April 09, 2010 <br \/>    <br \/>    Road Ahead column by Jeff Outhit<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional council is expected to vote this spring on a 20-year plan to get more of us out of our cars, at a cost of $4 billion funded by regular tax increases. <br \/>    <br \/>    The price tag includes $1.5 billion to expand and maintain roads and $2.5 billion to expand and operate rapid transit and regular buses. <br \/>    <br \/>    This estimate does not include $790 million to build a proposed rapid transit system, consisting of trains in Kitchener and Waterloo and fast buses in Cambridge. Senior governments have yet to agree to pay most construction costs.<br \/>    <br \/>    The transportation plan is meant to guide the community until 2031, when the regional population is expected to reach 729,000. Details are online at <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.movingforward2031.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.movingforward2031.ca<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Public input is welcomed April 13 in Kitchener (St. Andrew&#8217;s Presbyterian Church at 54 Queen St. N.) and April 15 in Waterloo (First United Church at 16 William St. W.) Both information sessions are from 6 to 9 p.m. Cambridge had a session April 8. <br \/>    <br \/>    The plan asserts the community will eventually choke on traffic congestion unless we ease up on driving. <br \/>    <br \/>    To generate $4 billion, regional taxes would rise about 1.2 per cent a year for the first five years, and then by 1.5 per cent a year for the next 15 years. <br \/>    <br \/>    Three preliminary issues to keep in mind: <br \/>    <br \/>    Are costs affordable? Planners have proposed easing into heavy transit costs. This delays some transit upgrades and advances some road expansions in the first five years. <br \/>    <br \/>    This is useful fine-tuning but the big question remains: Is it smart to spend two-thirds on transit and one-third on roads? This could be a hard sell.<br \/>    <br \/>    Are transit goals wishful thinking? A survey found 90 per cent of us agree people should drive less often. But half of us see this worthy goal as unachievable, while half think it could actually happen. <br \/>    <br \/>    The plan aims to make us more than three times more likely to ride transit by 2031. Transit would carry 17 per cent of all trips taken, compared to five per cent today. That&#8217;s a lifestyle revolution, and then some. It may be far-fetched.<br \/>    <br \/>    Are politicians ready to lead? The plan calls for better sidewalks to encourage walking, yet councillors balked at completing sidewalks on regional roads. The plan calls for higher parking fees to discourage driving, yet councillors provide free parking for regional employees at public expense.<br \/>    <br \/>    If you want to lead, it helps to practise what you preach.<br \/>    <br \/>    Jeff Outhit can be reached at 519-895-5642 or <a href=\"mailto:jouthit@therecord.com\">jouthit@therecord.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"04-09-2010 08:57 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"8"},"4829":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=fb7af83c525021d69d88304ee2ede3ef&amp;u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 447","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>leaffan<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204454\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?s=fb7af83c525021d69d88304ee2ede3ef&amp;p=4295#post4295\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20100524204454im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\"><b><u>Big plan, big costs, big questions <\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    Public input is welcomed April 13 in Kitchener (St. Andrew&#8217;s Presbyterian Church at 54 Queen St. N.) and April 15 in Waterloo (First United Church at 16 William St. W.)

For me, Moose Winooskis is the best place for watching sports hands down.

Candidates get a ton of surveys, and it's great to see when the results are being made available to the public. <br \/>   <br \/>   The Waterloo Region Crime Prevention Council (WRCPC) also sent a questionnaire to all regional and municipal candidates. We had a 60% return rate and all responses are now posted, without editing, commentary or endorsement, on our <a href=\"\/web\/20101016002611\/http:\/\/www.preventingcrime.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">website: www.preventingcrime.ca<\/a>. <br \/>   (Disclosure: I am Community Engagement staff with WRCPC and helped write, edit and communicate the questionnaire results). <br \/>   In an effort to keep crime prevention through social development front and centre during the 2010 Municipal Election, we invited candidates to participate in a survey about their <u>priorities for local crime prevention<\/u>. As with previous elections, the questionnaire was developed by our Municipal Task Force of the WRCPC in an effort to <u>provide the public with information about candidate&#8217;s priorities in preventing and reducing crime and victimization<\/u>.  Candidates were asked:<br \/>   &#8226;    Which areas of responsibility play a key role in building safer communities?<br \/>   &#8226;    How would you prioritize spending for crime prevention?<br \/>   &#8226;    How would you integrate smart approaches to crime prevention?<br \/>   &#8226;    How can the WRCPC further support you in your municipal role, if elected?<br \/>   <br \/>   This survey is part of our ongoing commitment to bring opportunities for community engagement to the residents of Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   If you dont' see a response from your candidate - contact them to ask the questions that were originally provided. People are also welcome to take these questions to candidate roundtables and debates. <br \/>   <br \/>   Any questions - you are more than welcome to contact me directly.

Numerous public meetings are planned before then, and there's no timeline for construction.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mathieson wants faster action by the province. &quot;I think the province is allowing them to study this to death, which is something that has happened in the past.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Highway 7\/8 consists of two lanes of opposing traffic, between Stratford and New Hamburg.<br \/>    <br \/>    The road widens to four lanes in New Hamburg and is a divided highway east of New Hamburg.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mathieson suggests the varied nature of the road, from a divided four-lane highway to two opposing lanes, encourages poor driver behaviour behind some grisly collisions.<br \/>    <br \/>    Roth identified several challenges for Highway 7\/8 planners, including:<br \/>    <ul><li>The historic Fryfogel Tavern that sits next to the highway.<\/li>   <li>The village of Shakespeare that's built on the highway.<\/li>   <li>Farm buildings that are close to the highway.<\/li>   <li>Merchant opposition, in New Hamburg, to a bypass route.<\/li>   <\/ul><br \/>    &quot;I think that's going to present some challenges, to come up with a final design that's going to sort of satisfy everyone,&quot; Roth said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mathieson says the province needs to expand Highway 7\/8, even if it fails to achieve a consensus.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It was 1974 when they last looked at doing this, and because the province couldn't build consensus, it never happened. We've lived with piecemeal work on that highway for that 32-year period. And now it's time for them to get serious, get the planning done and get on with construction.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    This summer, Highway 7\/8 is getting a $12-million facelift where it passes through New Hamburg.<br \/>    <br \/>    This includes resurfacing for almost nine kilometres, better ditching and culverts, new traffic signals at Wilmot-Easthope Road and at Nafziger Road, and upgraded signals at Hamilton Road and at Peel Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Deadly Hwy 7\/8 route needs addressing<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    September 27, 2008 <br \/>    Jeff Outhit, RECORD STAFF<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100526022045\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/420606\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/420606<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Critics are rallying to persuade the province against a new highway from New Hamburg to Stratford.<br \/>    <br \/>    Highway 7\/8 is overwhelmed today. A replacement, north or south of the current highway, is one option under review in a Ministry of Transportation planning study.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some farmers who might lose land to a new route are opposed. Merchants in New Hamburg are campaigning against any new route that bypasses their town.<br \/>    <br \/>    Their concerns are important. But who's speaking for the dead?<br \/>    <br \/>    Highway 7\/8 is a killer road, among the most dangerous in Ontario, a Record survey has found.<br \/>    <br \/>    Between 2000 and 2006, 13 people were killed in crashes along 29 kilometres from New Hamburg to Stratford, according to provincial collision records.<br \/>    <br \/>    This puts it among Ontario's deadliest roads, including Highway 6 above Hamilton (18 killed in 24 kilometres) and Highway 69 in Parry Sound (15 killed in 25 kilometres).<br \/>    <br \/>    The toll includes five killed in New Hamburg, on the undivided four-lane stretch, and seven killed between New Hamburg and Stratford, where the highway is two lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    Another 372 people were injured in crashes.<br \/>    <br \/>    Highway 7\/8 has lots of truck and tourist traffic but people still drive fast. In winter it can be a slippery mess, with reduced visibility.<br \/>    <br \/>    Drivers make risky passing decisions. They crash head-on, they rear-end each other, and they slide on ice and snow.<br \/>    <br \/>    Widening it is a challenge. There are homes fronting the road. A bypass would be needed to get around the village of Shakespeare.<br \/>    <br \/>    Recent upgrades in New Hamburg, including a new traffic light, may improve safety there.<br \/>    <br \/>    The best solution for traffic safety is to build a new highway with four divided lanes on a new route. There would be fewer head-on crashes, fewer rear-end crashes and no need for risky passing.<br \/>    <br \/>    Farmers and merchants have legitimate concerns about losing farmland and customers. They have understandable private interests to protect.<br \/>    <br \/>    There's also a public interest in preserving prime farmland, in supporting local businesses and in restraining highway costs.<br \/>    <br \/>    Perhaps all these interests can be met in some way, as planners ponder highway options.<br \/>    <br \/>    But the public interest in road safety can't be dismissed. There have been too many grisly collisions on Highway 7\/8. Something has to be done.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Highway just fine now<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    October 02, 2008 <br \/>    Paul Knowles<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100526022045\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/422972\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/422972<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Re: Deadly Hwy. 7\/8 Route Needs Addressing -- Sept. 27<br \/>    <br \/>    The column written by Jeff Outhit comes close to misrepresenting the position of the merchants and residents of New Hamburg.<br \/>    <br \/>    While it is true, as he said, that we are campaigning against any new route that bypasses our town, that does not mean we are opposing a safer highway between New Hamburg and Stratford. Outhit notes that there have been five deaths along the New Hamburg stretch of Highway 7 and 8 since 2000. In the past year, however, the dangerous intersections have been made significantly safer with the addition of traffic lights. These sets of lights -- along with realigned intersections -- have solved the safety issues while creating little or no delay for motorists.<br \/>    <br \/>    We oppose a new bypass further removed from entry points to the town because we already have the safe, modern, four-lane bypass that is Highway 7 and 8. No further changes are necessary for reasons of safety, or of efficiency.<br \/>    <br \/>    What happens west of New Hamburg is not our issue.

MTO hosted Public Information Centre (PIC) #4 in Shakespeare on January 17 and 18, 2011 and will soon complete the Preliminary Planning phase of the study. In the Preliminary Design phase, MTO will consider design alternatives for the highway corridor, including access locations.<br \/>   Regional Council has previously expressed support for improving the existing highway corridor through New Hamburg. MTO has presented a &#8220;gateway&#8221; interchange concept that would provide interchanges at Nafziger Road and Wilmot-Easthope Road, with service road connections. While an interchange at Nafziger Road may be appropriate, construction of the entire &#8220;gateway&#8221; interchange concept would likely make it very difficult to achieve several community objectives, such as maintaining access and reducing highway traffic noise. Regional staff has discussed this study with Township of Wilmot staff and will participate in a value engineering workshop in early March, and will propose to MTO consideration of alternative access arrangements, including roundabouts.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>REPORT<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Highway 7 &amp; 8 is a 2-lane and 4-lane rural highway that connects directly to the Conestoga Parkway, crosses the Township of Wilmot and continues to the west of the Region of Waterloo. It provides an important transportation link with communities such as Stratford as well as agricultural land uses in Wilmot, Oxford County and Perth County. The highway accommodates commuters, short- and medium-haul freight, agricultural operations and tourist traffic.<br \/>   In December 2005, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) completed a Study Design Report as the first phase of a review of transportation conditions on Highway 7 &amp; 8. MTO initiated the second phase of this work as a Class Environmental Assessment (EA) in May 2007 to develop a plan that addresses:<ul><li>Capacity, operation and safety needs along the 2-lane and 4-lane sections of Highway 7 &amp; 8 between Stratford and New Hamburg, and through the urban centres of Stratford, Shakespeare and New Hamburg, for the movement of people and goods; and<\/li>   <li>Linkage needs within the Analysis Area for broader transportation connections to other regions in the province.<\/li>   <\/ul>Attachment 1 shows the Analysis Area for the study. The study is currently in the Preliminary Planning phase (Attachment 2), during which MTO has examined issues such as alternatives to highway improvements (e.g. Transportation Demand Management, improved public transit, etc), potential improvements to the existing highway, and new highway route alternatives. MTO hosted Public Information Centre (PIC) #4, the last meeting of the Preliminary Planning phase, in Shakespeare on January 17 and 18, 2011, and has asked for PIC #4 comments by March 25, 2011. If the study proceeds to the Preliminary Design phase, MTO will examine:<ul><li>Horizontal and vertical alignments of the preferred route and crossing roads;<\/li>   <li>Roadway cross section;<\/li>   <li>Right-of-way width and property requirements;<\/li>   <li>Crossing road treatments (e.g. interchanges, at-grade intersections, grade separations);<\/li>   <li>Drainage requirements;<\/li>   <li>Roadway lighting requirements;<\/li>   <li>Mitigation measures (e.g. environmental protection).<\/li>   <\/ul>MTO will host the first PIC of the Preliminary Design phase, PIC #5, later this year. MTO has also proposed a value engineering workshop to review and develop a range of community access alternatives during the week of March 7-11, 2011. Value engineering workshops engage groups of technical professionals and stakeholders to develop and recommend a range of alternatives. Regional staff is reporting to Council at this time to provide PIC #4 comments at the conclusion of the Preliminary Planning phase.<br \/>   The focus of PIC #4 was to present the highway route around Shakespeare and east Stratford, and MTO has not changed their previous recommendation that Highway 7 &amp; 8 follow the existing alignment through New Hamburg. Regional Council previously expressed support for this alignment in Report P-09-067 (September 15, 2009).<br \/>   Community character, access, property impacts, pedestrian and cyclist access across the highway, traffic safety and traffic noise levels on Highway 7 &amp; 8 through New Hamburg are important considerations to the Region. Table 1 summarizes the existing access locations to Highway 7 &amp; 8 in the New Hamburg area.<br \/>   <br \/>   <div align=\"center\"><b>Table 1: Existing Accesses to Highway 7 &amp; 8 in New Hamburg Area (East to West)<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <table class=\"stg_table tborder\" style=\"width:500px; \"><tbody><tr class=\"alt2\"><td><u>Cross Street<\/u> <\/td><td> <u>Access Control<\/u><\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt1\"><td>Foundry Street\/Wilmot Centre Road (Baden) <\/td><td> Full interchange<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt2\"><td>Nafziger Road<\/td><td>Signalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt1\"><td>Hamilton Road\/Bleams Road East<\/td><td>Signalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt2\"><td>Victoria Street South<\/td><td>Unsignalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt1\"><td>Peel Street\/Haysville Road<\/td><td>Signalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt2\"><td>Walker Road<\/td><td>Unsignalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><tr class=\"alt1\"><td>Wilmot-Easthope Road<\/td><td>Signalized intersection<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.7.1 (stable) o.31 --><\/div><br \/>   MTO has previously noted that the corridor through New Hamburg will include a new median barrier on Highway 7 &amp; 8, modification and\/or closure of intersections, plus possible local sections of service road. These access management measures aim to provide a balance between safety, convenience and efficient traffic operations on the main highway corridor. Installation of a median barrier on the highway would likely result in the conversion of the Victoria Street South and Walker Road intersections to right-in\/right-out operation, or for them to be closed. In the case of Victoria Street South, traffic could divert to Hamilton Road. In the case of Walker Road, traffic to\/from the north could divert to Peel Street, whereas traffic to\/from the south could divert to Haysville Road or Wilmot-Easthope Road, most likely via Huron Road (Attachment 3).<br \/>   MTO previously noted that the existing 4-lane highway through New Hamburg will accommodate projected future traffic, but that traffic operations will decline unacceptably at the current at-grade intersections. At Public Information Centre #2B, MTO presented an access management concept involving &#8220;gateway&#8221; interchanges (i.e. interchanges only at the east and west limits of New Hamburg) and service roadways intended to provide community access while maintaining safe and efficient traffic operations on the highway (Attachment 4). MTO has not yet identified potential locations for the service roadways.<br \/>   Since the Township of Wilmot Official Plan directs much of New Hamburg&#8217;s future development to the east and plans for future roadway connections between Nafziger Road, Hamilton Road and Waterloo Street (Attachment 5), a &#8220;gateway&#8221; interchange may be appropriate at Nafziger Road. However, an interchange at Wilmot-Easthope Road may be inappropriate for the following reasons:<ol class=\"decimal\"><li>Traffic count data suggests that the majority of traffic accessing the highway in New Hamburg is directed to\/from the east (i.e. towards the Region);<\/li>   <li>This distribution is likely to become more pronounced since the Region is projected to grow faster than Perth or Oxford Counties;<\/li>   <li>The Regional Official Plan locates the Township Urban Area Boundary, the Township Designated Greenfield Areas, and the Township Urban Growth Centre well to the east of Wilmot-Easthope Road (Attachment 5), making an interchange unlikely to be well used;<\/li>   <li>MTO is unlikely to accept controlled intersections on a provincial highway between two interchanges, which means that access at Hamilton Road\/Bleams Road East and Peel Street\/Haysville Road would likely be lost;<\/li>   <li>The traffic signals that were recently installed at Wilmot-Easthope Road are effectively controlling traffic.<\/li>   <\/ol>Improvements to the existing traffic signals or roundabouts may be viable alternatives to improve traffic operations and maintain access at Peel Street\/Haysville Road and Hamilton Road\/Bleams Road East. Roundabouts would achieve a significant reduction in injury collisions and would help to improve traffic safety. In particular, Report E-10-076 (September 7, 2010) recently noted how the roundabout at the Arthur Street &amp; Sawmill Road intersection significantly reduces injury collisions, and this roundabout accommodates more traffic than the Peel Street\/Haysville Road and Hamilton Road\/Bleams Road East intersections with Highway 7 &amp; 8. MTO has also recently constructed a roundabout on a provincial highway, and is continuing to work with the Region on proposed roundabout designs to control highway ramps in the Homer Watson Boulevard and Ottawa Street area.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Next Steps<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Regional staff will attend the value engineering workshop during the week of March 7-11, 2011 to present the observations contained in this report.

The province has directed councils to plan for more than 1.2 million by 2031, partly as Toronto growth is restrained.<br \/>    <br \/>    Planners will look at rehabilitation of streams and rivers, reservoir operations, removal of outdated dams, groundwater protections and water conservation. The review is to conclude in 2010.<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Some who help manage the watershed doubt it can absorb the growth planned by the province.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;They're expecting us to accommodate too much growth,&quot; warns Puslinch Township Mayor Brad Whitcombe, who helps direct the conservation authority.<br \/>    <br \/>    However, governments can't tell people not to move here, says Robert Hillier, another director of the watershed agency.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;There's no way to prevent population from moving to southern Ontario. Or at least I haven't seen one,&quot; said Hillier, of Brantford.<br \/>    <br \/>    Residents take drinking water from the Grand as it flows from the Fergus area to Lake Erie. The river takes in runoff from farms and cities, and effluent from sewage treatment plants.<br \/>    <br \/>    By the time the Grand reaches the lake, it has degenerated into the third-foulest river in Ontario, after rivers in Toronto and Brampton.<br \/>    <br \/>    As bad as that sounds, the Grand is in better shape than it used to be, when raw sewage was a more common pollutant, and soil erosion was widespread.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We have come a long way, but I do believe we have a long way to go,&quot; Cooke said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Climate change has been making the watershed wetter since 1915. Average precipitation is up about 15 per cent. Planners figure climate change may bring more weather extremes, such as heavier dry spells and also heavier wet spells.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204914\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 05:18 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"2491":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204914im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Budget Overview<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204914\/http:\/\/www.grandriver.ca\/index\/document.cfm?Sec=12&amp;Sub1=52&amp;Sub2=0\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.grandriver.ca\/index\/docum...Sub1=52&amp;Sub2=0<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    The 2010 budget of just under $33 million, will pay the cost of GRCA programs that protect water quality, reduce flood damages, protect natural areas, support responsible development and provide outdoor recreation and environmental education. <br \/>    <br \/>    The budget is about $1.6 million greater than in 2009 but much of the increase is due to one-time stimulus grants from the federal and provincial governments for construction projects at conservation areas.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\">Revenues<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The GRCA has three main sources of revenue:<ul><li>$10 million (32 per cent) from watershed municipalities. The municipalities raise the money through their general tax rates or through charges on their water bills. The municipal levy works out to about $9.68 per person.<\/li>   <li>$8 million (25 per cent) from the provincial and federal governments. This includes regular operating grants, one-time capital grants under stimulus programs and money to pay for source water protection planning.<\/li>   <li>$13.4 million (43 per cent) in self-generated revenue such as money from campground fees, planning fees, tree sales, hydroelectricity generation, rental property income and other sources.<\/li>   <\/ul><b><font color=\"blue\">Expenditures<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The budget is broken down into four sections:<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Base operating budget -- $18.6 million (57 per cent).<\/b> This covers the ongoing programs of the GRCA including flood prevention, environmental education, planning advice to municipalities and landowners, operation of trails, forest management and others.<ul><li>About $1.4 million will be spent to complete a two-year upgrade to the Conestogo Dam near Drayton to allow it to safely discharge more water during periods of extremely high flows.<\/li>   <\/ul><b>Special Programs -- $2.1 million (6 per cent).<\/b> One-time projects or continuing programs that are usually paid for with money from outside sources. They include:<ul><li>$700,000 for the Rural Water Quality Program which provides grants to rural landowners to take action to protect water quality on the farm. The money is provided by watershed municipalities.<\/li>   <li>$300,000 to purchase environmentally sensitive land, covered by proceeds from earlier land sales.<\/li>   <li>$100,000 for a subwatershed study for the Upper Blair Creek area in the City of Kitchener, paid for by the city.<\/li>   <li>$200,000 to continue an update of the Grand River Basin Water Management Study. This will look at three issues: water quality, water supply and flood control on a watershed basis with an emphasis on addressing issues brought about by climate change and population growth. Municipalities, Six Nations and provincial and federal agencies are also participating in the program.<\/li>   <\/ul><b>Conservation Area operations -- $8.2 million (25 per cent).<\/b> Fees from park users cover the entire operating cost of the GRCA's 11 active conservation areas which draw more than one million paid visits a year.

In fact, the 451,000 trees going in the ground this year is nearly six times more than the 77,000 trees planted in 2007. <br \/>    <br \/>    Interest in tree planting is increasing and there is more financial help available for people and organizations that want to increase forest cover. About 177,000 trees will go onto GRCA-owned land, such as conservation areas and natural areas. This includes trees that will be planted by the public at the Brant Tree Coalition Tree Plant April 22, Guelph Rotary Forest at Guelph Lake on Saturday April 24, Chilligo Restoration project in Cambridge April 25, at Conestogo Conservation Area clean up and tree planting day May 1, Upper Grand Trailway Tree Planting Day in Grand Valley also May 1 and Waterloo Earth Fest on Saturday May 8. (Note: For details on these events, please see below.) <br \/>    <br \/>    The GRCA carries out numerous tree planting projects on both private and GRCA-owned property each spring. But most trees being ordered through the GRCA will go on private land \u2014 about 256,000 this spring. Plantings on private land are paid for by the property owners who require the service. If eligible, these costs may be offset by programs such as the Rural Water Quality Program. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt is really great to see that individuals are taking action to improve the health of the watershed,\u201d said Anne Loeffler, a GRCA conservation specialist. \u201cI work with them every day and I am really inspired by their commitment. Fortunately we have a wider range of funding programs to help them.\u201d <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cTree planting is definitely going in the right direction \u2014 up,\u201d said Martin Neumann, supervisor of terrestrial resources for the GRCA. He likes to list the many benefits of trees which go a long way towards creating a healthy environment, minimizing water problems and they are good for all living creatures. Plus, he likes to add, they are beautiful to look at. <br \/>    <br \/>    In the mid 1980s, the GRCA planted a million trees a year, so we still have a long way to go to get back up to those numbers. The drop in tree planting was because the province cut funding for trees and closed the provincial tree nurseries. <br \/>    <br \/>    But Neumann says tree planting numbers don\u2019t tell the entire story. Now tree planting projects are more complex, with a wider range of native tree species being planted to increase biodiversity. Bigger trees are being planted, not just small seedlings but saplings which have a greater chance of survival. The GRCA has also adopted the practice of \u201cdirect seeding\u201d in some projects, especially for oaks, hickories and walnuts. These numbers are not included in the tree tally mentioned previously. Native herbaceous seed mixes are being sown as a companion planting for young seedlings, and more emphasis is also being placed on restoring wetlands, prairies, and savannas \u2013 all part of a healthier and more sustainable environment. Many other trees are being planted through municipal or private initiatives. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cImagine how much we could accomplish if we collectively set our minds to it,\u201d Neumann said. The more companies, families, organizations and rural landowners who turn their attention to trees, the healthier the landscape will be for the next generation. <br \/>    <br \/>    For more information on tree planting for this fall or spring 2011, call 519-621- 2763 ext. 2269.

The Upper Blair Creek FDS was approved by Council on February 9, 2009 The study dealt with the technical issues related to hydrogeological and hydrological conditions of the watershed and the associated stormwater management measures that could be implemented to minimize changes from the current condition.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>REPORT:<\/b><br \/>    In 2003, the Upper Blair Creek Functional Drainage Study (FDS) was started in cooperation with the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA), the Region of Waterloo and the City of Kitchener. The City took the lead in completing the study. In 2004 a Technical Steering Committee was formed which included the GRCA, the Region, the City, and members of the Waterloo Region Homebuilders Association (WRHBA). Stantec Consultants were retained to complete the Upper Blair Creek FDS with extensive monitoring, research and analysis taking place along with consultation with the public, development industry and other government agencies.<br \/>    The Upper Blair Creek FDS deals with the technical issues pertaining to the hydrologic and hydrogeologic characteristics of the subwatershed existing conditions and a range of post- development conditions and associated stormwater management (SWM) measures that can be implemented to minimize the changes from current conditions.<br \/>    With the support of the detailed analysis, it was the conclusion of this Study that typical, urban development densities accompanied by a multi-component, infiltration-focussed SWM strategy can be implemented within the Upper Blair Creek subwatershed, and achieves the objectives as outlined in the governing watershed study (BBB).<br \/>    It was recommended that the comprehensive monitoring, maintenance, and mitigation program outlined in Section 6 in the FDS be implemented as a means of confirming existing background characteristics, design assumptions contained herein and within future model updates, and minimize the potential for negative impacts on the receiving system.<br \/>    The development of a comprehensive Monitoring, Maintenance, and Mitigation (MMM) program has been designed to provide all stakeholders with sufficient physical data to assess any ecological, hydrological, hydrogeological, or geomorphological impacts related to the development within the Upper Blair Creek drainage area, identify the source of such impacts, and adopt a strategy to reverse, eliminate, or minimize the potential for future repetition.<br \/>    In summary, staff from the City of Kitchener have supported the technical findings of the Upper Blair Creek Functional Drainage Study, approved in its entirety by Council (see Report DTS-09-010), and now recommend that the monitoring program designed by the GRCA based on the Upper Blair FDS with additional input from the GRCA and the City of Kitchener be implemented.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:<\/b> The Upper Blair Creek monitoring program was identified in the 2009 Development Charge Background Study. The ongoing monitoring program for the Upper Blair Creek will be funded from the Development Charges, Upper Blair Creek Monitoring account #59500643. In accordance with the 2009 capital forecast there is a balance of $145,642.00 remaining for 2010. Further the 2009 to 2019 ten year capital forecast allocated a total of $1,219,000 to complete this program from the development charge funds.

Planters are now putting in black walnuts, silver and sugar maples, white and burr oaks, cottonwoods, white cedars and white pines.<br \/>    <br \/>   During the winter, the area was seeded with smaller, non-woody plants that will protect the small trees. <br \/>    <br \/>   The cover plants include brown-eyed susans.<br \/>    <br \/>   Evening primrose and swamp milkweed are also on the list.<br \/>    <br \/>   About 15,000 trees will be planted here. In total, the Conservation Authority will plant 451,000 seedlings throughout the watershed this spring.<br \/>    <br \/>   &#8220;That 451,000 is a fivefold increase over just a few years ago,&#8221; Neumann said. &#8220;It sounds like a lot of trees, but it is a large area we need to do.&#8221; <br \/>    <br \/>   The Grand River flows for about 300 kilometres, from the Dufferin Country highlands in the north to Port <br \/>   Maitland on Lake Erie.<br \/>    <br \/>   Neumann is pumped.<br \/>    <br \/>   A few years ago Trees Ontario, a non-profit organization that flows money from the provincial government and private donors, started pumping a lot more money into tree planting across Ontario.<br \/>    <br \/>   Trees Ontario provided $30,000 for this planting.<br \/>    <br \/>   Once the seedlings are in the watching begins.<br \/>    <br \/>   &#8220;In any planting like this we are totally dependent on natural rainfall,&#8221; Neumann said. &#8220;That is probably the biggest challenge, re-establishing a forest through drought conditions.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>   The maples planted on this site are saplings with material wrapped around the skinny trunks for protection.<br \/>    <br \/>   Meadow voles are the biggest threat to the small trees.<br \/>    <br \/>   Rabbits, deer and gypsy moths also kill large numbers of small trees.<br \/>    <br \/>   &#8220;All four of those critters are looking for the maples, not the pines,&#8221; Neumann said.<br \/>    <br \/>   That&#8217;s why pines are so popular on some reforestation projects. But in trying to recreate the original Carolinian Forest the conservation authority must select seedlings that are more vulnerable to the animals that can kill young trees.<br \/>    <br \/>   The Pioneers Memorial Tower and nearby cemetery are dramatic reminders of the first white settlers to arrive in this area in 1800&#8212;Joseph Sherk and his wife Elizabeth Betzner, Samuel Betzner and his wife Maria Detweiler.<br \/>    <br \/>   The farms spread from the banks on the Grand River, laying waste to the original forest. By 1900, forest cover was down to five per cent and all the surrounding wetlands were drained.<br \/>    <br \/>   Without the forest the watershed started falling apart, Dave Shultz, the GRCA&#8217;s spokesperson, said.<br \/>    <br \/>   Trees shaded the snow and slowed the spring melt. Trees also suck up a lot of water. Wetlands held back a lot of the spring melt, slowly releasing it into the river.

The City of Waterloo is thinking about it. Other cities, such as Toronto and Ottawa, have adopted the charter.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;The walkability of a community is an indicator of the quality of life of that community,&quot; Jennifer Robertson-Wilson of the Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee, says.<br \/>    <br \/>    And Wellar has lots of advice for improving the quality of life in our cities.<br \/>    <br \/>    A municipality, he said, should not receive any transportation-related funds from Queen's Park or Ottawa until it has a plan for increasing walking, cycling and the use of public transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    Climate change, increasing oil prices, traffic congestion and poor air quality will force changes on city governments and individuals.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;If walkability doesn't become a major part of transportation planning in the next 10 years, I think you are in trouble,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    A quick look at some of the municipal budgets in this region shows there is no balance to transportation spending. Roads get the overwhelming amount of taxpayer dollars; sustainable transportation -- walking, cycling and transit -- get comparatively little.<br \/>    <br \/>    This year, Kitchener will spend $17.2 million on roads, $1.6 million on sidewalks and $486,000 on paths and trails.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge will spend $10.3 million on roads, $225,000 on sidewalks, $204,000 for on-road bike lanes, and $35,000 for off-road trails.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Waterloo, roads will get $6.9 million, sidewalks $254,000 and bike paths $250,000.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;Let's be honest, the vast majority of money goes into roads,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo Region is the only municipal government in this region that approaches balanced spending between infrastructure for roads and sustainable transportation -- at least for 2008.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo Region will spend $92.5 million this year on roads. But it will also spend $81 million on Grand River Transit. It will also spend $1.6 million to build 108 kilometres of sidewalks and bike paths.<br \/>    <br \/>    Municipal governments must do a lot more to get people using sustainable transportation, Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We are talking about simul-taneously increasing walking, biking and transit and at the same time decreasing the use of the private automobile,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    Data on sustainable transportation from the most recent census shows that pedestrian advocates have a lot of work to do when it comes to changing the behaviour of people in the cities of this region. For the first time ever, the 2005 census asked people how they get around -- driving a car, riding in a car, walking, cycling or transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Cambridge, 60,560 use private vehicles, 2,190 use transit, 2,020 walk and 565 cycle.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Kitchener, 104,750 use private vehicles, 6,445 ride buses, 4,870 walk and 1,360 ride bikes.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Waterloo, 49,530 use vehicles while 2,270 use transit, 3,740 walk and 1,525 ride bicycles.<br \/>    <br \/>    Such numbers don't discourage Wellar, who says cities must spend more on sustainable transportation before more people walk, ride bicycles or use transit. In short, stop treating pedestrians like third-class citizens, he says.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;If you want to encourage walking, you don't want people standing in snow, standing in slush, standing in water,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wellar is scathing in his criticism of cities that do not plow sidewalks in the winter. The cities in this region plow some sidewalks in their downtowns and some public property. But city crews do not remove snow from the overwhelming majority of sidewalks and bus-stops.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;I don't believe it. Wow! It seems to me there is some money to be made here. This is shocking,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    He testified recently in a lawsuit where a Toronto man sued the city after slipping and falling on a winter sidewalk. The man broke his knee. That case is still before the court.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wellar was also an expert witness in a slip-and-fall case in Ottawa where a woman broke her ankle. She was awarded thousands of dollars.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;If I was going to be an expert witness at a trial I would love to do it here. If a municipality defaults snow clearing to citizens it is a recipe for disaster,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    The cities of this region require property owners adjacent to city sidewalks to clear the snow within 24 hours after the end of a storm. Other cities, such as London and Guelph, plow all city-owned sidewalks.<br \/>    <br \/>    Priority for snow-clearing should be transit routes and sidewalks, not roads, he says.<br \/>    <br \/>    Municipal governments are willing to see citizens get hurt, and then make payments in slip-and-fall cases, rather than clear sidewalks of snow, Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;That strikes me as pretty disgusting logic,&quot; Wellar says. &quot;You have to be concerned that bean counters are calling the shots.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Over the past nine years, the cities of this region paid about $1.5 million in claims after someone slipped on a public sidewalk.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Cambridge, the payouts totalled $192,542 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2007, when payments totalled $130,550.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Kitchener, the payouts have totalled $1.1 million since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003 when the city paid out $205,442.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Waterloo, the payments totalled $234,906 since 2000. The worst year since then was 2003, when the city paid out $81,578.<br \/>    <br \/>    When it comes to treating pedestrians as third-class citizens, Wellar traces the problem to a book called the Highway Capacity Manual, Bureau of Public Roads, in the United States. A Bible of sorts for traffic engineers.<br \/>    <br \/>    The first order of business, according to that influential tome, is the convenience, comfort and safety of drivers.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wellar developed the walkability security index for the City of Ottawa more than 10 years ago, subverting the principles used by traffic engineers in the manual.<br \/>    <br \/>    This was done, in part, to counter the arguments of traffic engineers at hearings of the Ontario Municipal Board -- a provincial tribunal that rules on land-use disputes.<br \/>    <br \/>    City governments should be increasing the safety, comfort and convenience of pedestrians with every street, sidewalk, intersection, roundabout, trail, bike path and set of traffic signals, Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    Currently, traffic signals are used at intersections to ensure the smooth flow of traffic, not the safe crossing of pedestrians.<br \/>    <br \/>    And the expansion of intersections usually spells disaster for walkers.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;What is our legal liability here?&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    A walkability test should be applied to all transportation projects, every city's Official Plan, amendments to those plans, each application to change land use in a municipality, and site plan agreements for individual developments.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wellar says sidewalks and pedestrian paths should be designed and constructed to serve and promote community and neighbourhood walkability.<br \/>    <br \/>    While increasing expenditures on infrastructure for walking, biking and public transit, city governments should stop widening roads. Parking lots along King Street should be zoned out of existence and replaced with high-density housing because it is well served by public transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;You are not dependent on an automobile if you can walk, ride a bike or take transit. So it is a choice. It is a proclivity. It's just proclivity. It is not dependence at all,&quot; Wellar says.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>The numbers<\/b><br \/>    214,840 - People who rely on vehicles to get around, according to the 2005 census, in Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>    10,905 - People who take transit in the three cities, according to the 2005 census.<br \/>    3,450 - People riding bikes to get from place to place.<br \/>    34.4 million - Spending in dollars on roads this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br \/>    2 million - Spending on sidewalks this year by Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo<br \/>    1.5 million - Payments over nine years by the region's cities because of claims by people who slip on sidewalks.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204919\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 05:25 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 05:27 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"3"},"318":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\"><b>Pedestrian Issues in Waterloo Region<\/b><\/font><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/miamirealestatecafe.com\/files\/2009\/07\/pedestrian-7204621.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <font size=\"1\"><a href=\"\/web\/20100524204919\/http:\/\/miamirealestatecafe.com\/2009\/08\/08\/how-to-choose-a-miami-neighborhood-ever-had-a-neighbor-you-wished-you-didnt-wish-youd-known-before-you-bought\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/miamirealestatecafe.com\/2009\/...re-you-bought\/<\/a><\/font> <\/div>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204919\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 05:24 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"04-27-2010 08:46 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"1"},"5659":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\"><b>Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee<\/b><\/font><\/font><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204919\/http:\/\/www.together4health.ca\/workgroups\/pedestrian-charter\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.together4health.ca\/workgr...strian-charter<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/www.together4health.ca\/files\/imagecache\/logo\/logos\/pedestrian.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div><br \/>    <b>Who We Are <\/b><br \/>    We are a citizens' group.

Gom\u00e9z-Palacio is a principal with the Toronto-based urban design and planning firm called Office for Urbanism.<br \/>    <br \/>    Gom\u00e9z-Palacio said to make the transition from a car-dependent city to a walkable city, every department at city hall must be involved.<br \/>    <br \/>    High-density, mixed-use developments are key. Complete communities are needed where everyday needs can be satisfied within one square kilometre. Buildings should come right out to the edge of sidewalks, which are wide and shaded by trees.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sidewalks are needed on both sides of the street and there should be crosswalks that make people feel comfortable and safe.<br \/>    <br \/>    Such streets become destinations and can be viewed as part of the city&#8217;s collection of open spaces, Gom\u00e9z-Palacio, said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;If it is a beautiful, gorgeous street you will want to walk it, you will want to congregate and linger and meet people, and have your children walk up and down the street,&#8221; Gom\u00e9z-Palacio said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Pedestrianism is a worldwide trend, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;People have recognized that pedestrian environments are linked to quality of life,&#8221; Gom\u00e9z-Palacio said. &#8220;So think about the best places you can imagine in the world and they are all pedestrian-oriented.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    He added: &#8220;The highest quality of life is always in and around environments that are pedestrian- oriented.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    In some ways, this area is going backwards when it comes to walkable urban environments.<br \/>    <br \/>    Years after municipal councils adopted the Pedestrian Charter, Veronica Walsh, 51, was killed on Victoria Street North in January. She was crossing midblock because there are no sidewalks on that stretch of Victoria Street. <br \/>    <br \/>    Walsh was in a wheelchair and would have had to roll down the multi-lane roadway to the nearest intersection at Frederick Street to cross at a traffic signal.<br \/>    <br \/>    Walsh was the second woman killed trying to cross that stretch of road within the past two years.<br \/>    <br \/>    As some residents advocate for better walking conditions, the City of Kitchener is going in the opposite direction in some cases.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener has committed or earmarked about $70 million for the construction of parking garages in and around the downtown. This is happening while Waterloo Region lobbies for up to $800 million for light trail transit through Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>    The City of Kitchener also fell way behind on the construction of trails in suburban neighbourhoods.

Each week, on average, two people are struck by a vehicle.<br \/>    <br \/>    Vehicles killed four pedestrians here last year and three the year before that.<br \/>    <br \/>    So far in 2010, two pedestrians died after being struck by vehicles, including a woman in a wheelchair on a stretch of Victoria Street North that has no sidewalks.<br \/>    <br \/>    Henderson has carefully studied the data for the years 2004 to 2008. He\u2019s found several trends:<br \/>    <br \/>    The number of pedestrian collisions each year ranged from 109 to 119.<br \/>    <br \/>    Between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of pedestrian collisions occur at signalized intersections when the pedestrian has the right-of-way.<br \/>    <br \/>    Most often, the driver is turning left against oncoming traffic and is watching for a chance to turn. After committing to the turn, the driver plows into a pedestrian who is stepping off the curb to cross with the signal.<br \/>    <br \/>    Other times, the driver is looking for a break in the traffic in order to make a right turn and plows into a pedestrian crossing with the walk signal.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI can\u2019t accept that as being a good track record,\u201d Henderson said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Roundabouts are much safer for pedestrians than signalized intersections, Henderson said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The region\u2019s first roundabout was built in 2004 at Ira Needles Boulevard and Erb Street West. The region now has 13 roundabouts open to traffic and more than 15 others are planned.<br \/>    <br \/>    Between January 2005 and March 2009, there was only one pedestrian struck by a vehicle in that first roundabout at Ira Needles Boulevard and Erb Street West. It was minor and the pedestrian walked away from the mishap.<br \/>    <br \/>    Henderson said that roundabout was compared to 158 signalized intersections with similar amounts of vehicles and pedestrians.<br \/>    <br \/>    There were 63 pedestrian collisions at those signalized intersections during the same period.<br \/>    <br \/>    Roundabouts are built in areas that do not get a lot of foot traffic, so Henderson refined his analysis further by comparing that first roundabout to signalized intersections that get an average of only 34 pedestrians a day.<br \/>    <br \/>    In that category there were 15 pedestrian collisions compared to one at the Ira Needles-Erb Street roundabout.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWhen you look at data and research around the world on the subject, it is no different than ours, it supports the fact that roundabouts are remarkably safer for pedestrians than traffic signals,\u201d Henderson said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:tpender@therecord.com\">tpender@therecord.com<\/a><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204919\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/682318\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/682318<\/a>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> I'm all for giving pedestrians the right of way, its important to protect them so that people will walk more.

So before I cross, I look in all directions to ensure that there are no cars (or bikes &lt;ducks&gt; <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/freevbulletintemplates.org\/forum\/images\/smilies\/wink.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Wink\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/> ) within striking distance, and then I cross, red lights be damned.<br \/>   <br \/>   As for the pedestrian charter, pardon my cynicism but there's no political will to tackle the problems we pedestrians have faced for decades in K-W. Let me give a simple example.  Waterloo has several walking\/cycling paths that lead to uptown including one that follows Laurel Creek from City Hall out to Hillside Park and beyond to Manulife out in the 'burbs. The problem is that to get from one end of the trail to the other you have to cross several major arteries like Bridgeport Rd, University Ave. and Columbia St. These crossings aren't signalled or crosswalked or even signed for the attention of car drivers. They're all located a couple of hundred meters from the nearest &quot;safe&quot; crossing point at an intersection. Now all of these are roads are multi-lane, traffic moves on them well in excess of posted speed limits and traffic is particularly heavy on them at times when pedestrians would want to cross them on their way to\/from work. You don't need to be an junior traffic engineer to appreciate that this situation, which has been the status quo for years, discourages people from walking (or cycling) to work. The situation is similar along the Iron Horse trail in Kitchener and although the streets aren't as wide, there are more of them to cross.<br \/>   <br \/>   Now politicians and traffic engineers in Waterloo Region appreciate this situation, yet with the sole exception of the Erb St crossing, they've done nothing about it in the past several years even with input from the Pedestrian Charter Steering Committee. They seem to have no trouble finding $millions to build new roads for car commuters but not even a fraction of that to make our urban trails a more practical, greener and safer alternative.","signature":"","date":"03-18-2010 11:08 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"9"},"3220":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204919im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,027","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"I think you got it dead on, cross when it's safe to do so, not when there's a car directly in front of you, its just a matter of making smart decisions.<br \/>   <br \/>   As for political will, as a result of the two incidents early on in 2010 I wouldn't be too surprised to see it come up amongst election candidates.","signature":"","date":"03-18-2010 11:25 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"10"},"3684":{"user":{"name":"IEFBR14","avatar":null,"title":"Senior Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation H2OWC    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 306","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"While the article appears in the Toronto Star it's just as valid in Waterloo Region: <a href=\"\/web\/20100526023035\/http:\/\/thestar.blogs.com\/yourcitymycity\/2010\/03\/pedestrians-city-orphans--we-can-call-it-the-baby-stroller-effect-when-a-mom-pushing-a-stroller-was-killed-by-a-car.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pedestrians are the city's orphans<\/a><div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\tWe can call it the \u201cbaby stroller effect\u201d; when a mom pushing a stroller was killed by a car, it made the front page of all papers; much time in TV news was focused on it and everyone became concerned.

And although Faruzel is the first to say that accessibility is improving all the time, it was proof that challenges still abound.<br \/>    <br \/>    Faruzel and his friend Jeff Kratky guided small groups through the downtown core on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, one of the series of walks dedicated to urban writer and thinker Jane Jacobs.<br \/>    <br \/>    Travelling along city streets and through Victoria Park, the pair highlighted several examples of thoughtful consideration for those with physical challenges \u2014 and noted other places that would remain off-limits.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWhen I was young, there were no ramps anywhere,\u201d said Faruzel, board chair for Kitchener-Waterloo Access-Ability. \u201cNow, people are getting older \u2026 It\u2019s just getting better for everyone.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    But for every fully-accessible business or well-designed intersection, it\u2019s not that difficult to find obstacles like stairs or uncut curbs.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe\u2019re not consistent with what he needs,\u201d noted participant Dianne Arndt.<br \/>    <br \/>    And it\u2019s not always an all-or-nothing situation, Kratky pointed out. The city-owned Boathouse, for example, is fully accessible through the external washroom doors \u2014 which proved fine during a visit once by Faruzel, until city staff locked those outside doors later in the evening.<br \/>    <br \/>    With no Boathouse employees in possession of a key, Faruzel was essentially marooned inside the venue until some patrons jury-rigged a ramp out of some scrap wood.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cYou have to be able to improvise. Things may not be exactly 100 per cent perfect,\u201d Faruzel said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI was happy that there was awareness being raised for some of these issues,\u201d said participant Irene Metzger, whose son faces accessibility challenges.<br \/>    <br \/>    Metzger said she shares Faruzel\u2019s belief that, for the most part, the situation is improving. When Metzger raised concerns, for example, about a sidewalk problem near her home, city staff were quick to respond.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cSome people move here because this city is more accessible,\u201d she said.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>","signature":"","date":"05-03-2010 09:53 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"14"},"6034":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100526023035im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,036","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20100526023035im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>IEFBR14<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20100526023035\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=6030#post6030\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20100526023035im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">[Do we need a separate thread on accessibility issues?]<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> I think for now this is the right spot for this.

We carry nearly 55 million passengers a year in an extensive network of train and bus services that is one of North America&#8217;s premier transportation systems. Since we began operating in May 1967, over one billion people have taken the GO Train or the GO Bus. Officially known as the Greater Toronto Transit Authority (GTTA), GO Transit provides safe, convenient, and efficient transportation to the communities of the Toronto area.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Background<\/b><br \/>    GO Transit is Canada's first interregional transit system created and funded by a provincial government. On May 14, 2009, GO Transit officially merged with Metrolinx. This new, combined agency is known as Metrolinx.   <br \/>    <br \/>    A new Board of Directors has been appointed by the Province. The Minister of Transportation sets the strategy and policy framework for Metrolinx, and the Board provides business direction to staff. <br \/>    <br \/>    Visit the Ministry of Transportation website for other information. <br \/>    <br \/>    We recover most of our operating costs through revenue, consistently bringing in 80% to 90% of what we need to run our service from the farebox &#8212; one of the best financial performances for any transit system in the world. The Provincial government subsidizes any operating costs that are not recovered through revenue. It is also responsible for the base capital funding needed for rehabilitation and replacement, to keep our system in a state of good repair. For growth and expansion capital costs, the province provides one-third of GO&#8217;s capital funding needs, with the understanding that the federal and municipal governments will contribute the remaining two-thirds.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Our service area<\/b><br \/>    GO Trains and GO Buses serve a population of seven million in a 10,000-square-kilometre area (approximately 4,000 square miles) extending from downtown Toronto to Kitchener-Waterloo in the west; Orangeville, Barrie, and Beaverton to the north; Stouffville, Uxbridge, and Peterborough in the northeast; and Oshawa and Newcastle in the east. We connect with every municipal transit system in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton areas, including the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).<br \/>    <br \/>    The Greater Toronto Area consists of the City of Toronto and the surrounding Regions of Halton, Peel, York, and Durham. GO Transit also serves the neighbouring City of Hamilton, and reaches into Simcoe, Dufferin, and Wellington Counties.<br \/>    <br \/>    Our seven train lines are Lakeshore West, Milton, Georgetown, Barrie, Richmond Hill, Stouffville, and Lakeshore East. At peak rush-hour periods, train service is available at all stations. <br \/>    <br \/>    In weekday off-peak hours, trains run only on the Lakeshore between Oshawa in the east and Aldershot in the west, and on the Georgetown line between Union Station in the east and Bramalea in the northwest. On weekends, trains run only between Oshawa in the east and Aldershot in the west. Bus connections extend our Lakeshore service to Newcastle in the east and Hamilton in the west.<br \/>    <br \/>    Off-peak GO Buses between Union Station and other train stations (sometimes nicknamed train-buses) give passengers more choice when travelling to and from downtown Toronto before and after rush hour when the trains aren&#8217;t scheduled to run, even on weekends. More riders are choosing Union Station buses because they appreciate having the flexibility of travelling one way by train and the other by bus. <br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Ridership<\/b><br \/>    GO runs 185 train trips and 2,177 bus trips daily, carrying about 217,000 passengers on a typical weekday &#8212; 180,000 on the trains* and 37,000 by bus. Our ridership growth has continually exceeded expectations: The original GO Train service carried 2.5 million passengers in 1967, the first year of operation; today the combined rail and bus system handles nearly 55 million riders annually.<br \/>    <br \/>    At least 96% of our train ridership is to and from Union Station in downtown Toronto, while about 70% of all bus passengers travel to and from the City of Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    * Train service consists of trains and their related bus services &#8212; buses that meet the trains at terminus stations, and buses that connect Union Station with other train stations.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>GO by the numbers<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Train service <br \/>    Lines  7  <br \/>    Stations   59 <br \/>    Route kilometres  390 <br \/>    Weekday train trips 185  <br \/>    Fleet size (number of trainsets)  41 <br \/>    Locomotives   56 <br \/>    Bi-level passenger railcars  470 <br \/>    <br \/>    Bus service <br \/>    Terminals *  17 <br \/>    Route kilometres  2,819 <br \/>     Weekday bus trips, total system 2,177 <br \/>    Weekday Union Station bus trips <br \/>    (included in total above)  471 <br \/>    Buses  401 <br \/>     * Plus numerous stops &amp; ticket agencies <br \/>    <br \/>    <b>System Map:<\/b> 2009Rev7 <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.gotransit.com\/publicroot\/en\/schedule\/sysmap.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.gotransit.com\/publicroot\/...le\/sysmap.aspx<\/a><br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.gotransit.com\/publicroot\/en\/schedule\/web_system_map.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 06:03 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 09:44 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"1"},"321":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Two cities vying for GO link<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    February 20, 2008 <br \/>    JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/311459\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/311459<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Regional councillors agree more must be done to persuade GO Transit to extend commuter rail here.<br \/>    <br \/>    But if Ontario extends intercity transit to Toronto, should it come to Cambridge or Kitchener?<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun.

Sean Strickland of Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are separate rail lines going through Kitchener and Cambridge that could, with upgrades, support commuter rail to Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    However, planning for commuter rail into Kitchener is more advanced than plans for rail going into Cambridge, according to regional staff.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 2006, Ontario pledged to look at the Kitchener route in considering improved commuter rail service.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Kitchener route already has a business plan. It estimates startup costs for commuter rail at $78 million and operating costs at almost $4 million a year in 2004 dollars.<br \/>    <br \/>    Meanwhile, GO Transit has launched a study into extending passenger service into Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    Despite this, Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig says there's no reason why commuter rail should not come to his city.

There was nothing, nada, not a flipping red cent for any of these essential projects in this week's federal budget.<br \/>    <br \/>    But then, out of nowhere, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty pledged to put a rail service through to Peterborough that will just happen to pass through his own federal riding of Whitby-Oshawa.<br \/>    <br \/>    What gives? Flaherty denies that politics played any role in the project, which benefits not only his constituents but those in three other Conservative ridings as well as those in the Conservative provincial riding held by his wife, Christine Elliott. Flaherty may be right. But if he is, how else can his justify his bizarre decision?<br \/>    <br \/>    It can't be sheer need. While Waterloo Region's population has topped half a million, Peterborough's is only 80,000. The federal census of seven years ago estimated that 10,000 commuters leave Waterloo Region each day -- most of them heading down the increasingly clogged 401. Surely at least some of those people would leap at the chance to go by rail. In comparison, the estimate -- and it is not necessarily a reliable estimate -- of the number of passengers who would use the Peterborough line daily is 900.<br \/>    <br \/>    Flaherty can't have based his call on a business case either, because there really isn't one for the Peterborough line outside of a document cobbled together by Peterborough's Conservative MP Dean Del Mastro. In fact, a study by GO Transit, the provincial agency that serves Toronto-area regional commuters, declared two years ago it wasn't even worthwhile to extend a GO bus service to Peterborough. There just weren't enough riders and 70 per cent of the route's costs would have to be subsidized. Moreover, the area isn't growing that fast. So why is Flaherty willing to pay for rail upgrades, which Del Mastro estimated could cost $150 million?<br \/>    <br \/>    So weak is the case for the Peterborough line that Flaherty's own department this week was unable to say how many passesngers would use it, what it would cost, or even who would run it.<br \/>    <br \/>    In contrast, there is a documented business case for better passenger service on the north mainline that passes through Waterloo Region on the way to Toronto. Likewise, the case for some kind of rapid transit system within the region is so strong that the Ontario government has committed to covering two-thirds of its cost. And a GO commuter service to Waterloo Region would be far more feasible with federal help. But this need, too, is ignored.<br \/>    <br \/>    As oil prices and environmental concerns rise, Canada needs better rail service. In theory, restoring the train links that Peterborough lost in 1990 is a good thing. However, governments need to set priorities and those priorities should be based on the needs of the people, not the politicians. Not long ago, Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig observed that transit funding went to the places that lobbied hardest for it because, &quot;It's all about politics.'' Sadly, Craig may be right. But it is no way to run a railroad.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 06:03 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 06:14 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"2"},"322":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">One voice stronger than seven<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    DOUG HUTTON, Guest Column - Mar 11, 2008 - 12:00 AM<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/opinion\/columns\/article\/86036--one-voice-stronger-than-seven\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/opinion...ger-than-seven<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Well here we go again; the train passes us by and goes to Peterborough while our politicians bicker internally within Waterloo Region about whether it should go to Cambridge or K-W, when both need it.<br \/>    <br \/>    In the Feb. 20 edition of The Record, Claudette Millar is reported as pushing for a Cambridge rail link with Toronto, while Waterloo Region has a well advanced study to bring a similar service to Kitchener. We need to give our heads a collective shake.<br \/>    <br \/>    Shouldn't our political leaders be working together to develop a transportation concept that would service all major population centres within the region rather than competing to get the benefit for &quot;their town&quot;?<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional councillors have a responsibility to approve and implement projects that benefit the total region. Millar thinks her sole role is to vote for projects that benefit Cambridge only, rather than other municipalities in the region. Certainly a regional councillor should be vigilant to ensure his or her constituents are treated equitably but that is only part of the job. Regional councillors have a responsibility to look at the big picture and that big picture is Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    While we in Waterloo Region pursue local and sometimes conflicting agendas, Jim Flaherty makes a blatant pork barrel commitment to put a rail service through Peterborough and his home riding of Whitby-Oshawa.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Record editorial of March 1 reported that the economics of this rail link are poor in comparison to a link from Waterloo Region to the Metro Toronto area. The Record is correct. The public transit needs of Waterloo Region (population 500,000) and Peterborough, (population 80,000) are vastly different.<br \/>    <br \/>    Why this conundrum? Millar's comment, &quot;My priority is pretty clear&quot;, on Feb. 20 regarding which city should get the rail connection to Toronto, typifies our problem in Waterloo Region. By pursuing parochial interests we miss a huge opportunity to gain not only provincial support but also federal support for important infrastructure projects that benefit all citizens of Waterloo Region. Both senior levels of government seem quite happy to ignore &quot;seven small municipalities&quot; in Waterloo Region that invariably shoot themselves in the proverbial foot through their self-serving antics. The losers are the citizens of Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some local politicians just won't admit that great things are accomplished for the citizens of Waterloo Region when they join together to pursue common goals that benefit all municipalities in the region. The recent hospital crisis provides an example.<br \/>    <br \/>    This region has received less than its fair share of support for infrastructure, arts, culture and health care. The individual voices of our seven separate municipalities are simply not taken seriously by Queen's Park and Ottawa.<br \/>    <br \/>    Yet, Waterloo Region has changed from a group of small towns to a significant mid-sized city and widely recognized economic powerhouse. We need to present our community in a manner that gains the respect and support we deserve from higher levels of government. It is not sufficient to send messages or requests to Queen's Park or Ottawa from single municipalities within the region. Instead we need a continuous united lobbying effort to keep important local issues on the provincial and federal agendas.<br \/>    <br \/>    Citizens for Better Government promotes greater co-operation among the municipalities of Waterloo Region and exists with the sole purpose of &quot;finding a better way&quot; to structure local government.<br \/>    <br \/>    Doug Hutton is the Citizens for Better Government vice-chair<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Jim's chuffed with his train<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Mar 15, 2008 04:30 AM <br \/>    Bill Taylor, Toronto Star<br \/>    <br \/>    In the hurly-burly of the political arena, so much gets done in the heat of the moment that it's always good to see cooler heads prevail.<br \/>    <br \/>    Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who, in his recent budget, baffled many people by announcing a high-speed rail line between Toronto and Peterborough, has had time to reflect on what might otherwise be quite wrongly regarded as pork-barrelling at its most egregious; a Conservative crowd-pleasing anachronism.<br \/>    <br \/>    Flaherty, having looked up &quot;anachronism&quot; and its meaning and committed it to memory (and written it on his hand in case he forgets), is now vowing, &quot;This will be the biggest and best anachronism Canada has ever seen, a monument to our far-reaching policies.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    The civil servants tasked with making these words flesh are being given unprecedented access to Prime Minister Stephen Harper's personal library and his priceless collection of Thomas the Tank Engine original manuscripts. <br \/>    <br \/>    (Tory insiders are cackling that this is one in the eye for the Liberals, given that deputy leader Michael Ignatieff's Gutenberg first-edition of Walter the Farting Dog is a literary wonder but seems unlikely ever to be of practical use to his party. NDP Leader Jack Layton, meanwhile, is repining a recent fire in his party's library that destroyed both books, one of which members hadn't finished colouring.)<br \/>    <br \/>    A spokesperson for Flaherty, who pleaded not to be identified, told this column: &quot;The minister has thought long, hard and deeply &#8211; well, maybe not deeply &#8211; about this and, in retrospect, believes that instead of having his shoes resoled for the budget, the money would have been better spent on one of those cool striped engine-driver's caps. But he believes now he's on the right track, ha-ha.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Flaherty's new trains will actually be old trains, powered by steam locomotives refurbished with no expense spared to the public purse. Though, says the spokesperson, the Tories &quot;hope to kick in a few bucks by filing libel suits against mouthy opposition MPs. And having bake sales.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    The engines will be named in honour of Thomas and his colleagues: Henry, Gordon, James, etc. There will only be two passenger cars per train &#8211; traffic on the line is not expected to be heavy &#8211; and each pair will be dubbed Annie and Clarabelle after the duo that are Thomas's customary followers.<br \/>    <br \/>    Asked how this could be considered a high-speed line, the spokesperson, after fidgeting for a while, replied: &quot;Compared to how fast a stagecoach could get you from Toronto to Peterborough, it'll be pretty darned quick.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    The anticipated $150 million cost of restoring the track includes replacing welded rails with old-style short segments to give the train an authentic jolting ride and &quot;biddly-bong, biddly-bong&quot; sound to complement the &quot;chuff, chuff, chuff.&quot; Station staff will be provided with pocket watches and steel-rimmed spectacles which, for employees with 20-20 vision, will have plain glass in them.<br \/>    <br \/>    Anyone taking the train will be expected to enter into the spirit of the venture and wear period costume.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;This should bring at least two additional industries, corsetry and crinolines, to Durham Region,&quot; said Flaherty's flack. &quot;There's likely, too, to be considerable resurgence in the sale of derby hats and button boots. An economic boom; everybody wins.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Also in keeping with the good old days, passengers will be required to smoke during their journey. This could be seen as potentially derailing the new line but, as the spokesperson pointed out, &quot;We have to keep ridership down somehow. The trains will only have two cars, remember, and the Prime Minister is most insistent that he doesn't want poor Annie and Clarabelle overburdened.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GO studies Guelph-Toronto rail service<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <b>Trains could run as often as every 20 minutes during rush hour, GO Transit says<\/b><br \/>    May 13, 2008 09:04 AM<br \/>    Magda Konieczna, Guelph Mercury<br \/>    <br \/>    GUELPH-GO rail service could be coming to Guelph.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit decided last week to start a study of what it would take and how big the customer base would be.<br \/>    <br \/>    There could eventually be a train every 20 minutes during rush hour - heading to Toronto in the morning and back to Guelph and beyond in the evening - and every hour outside of rush times.<br \/>    <br \/>    But it would take years to get to that point. For now, GO Transit has hired engineering consultant R.J. Burnside to do an environmental assessment, which could take until early 2009.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit could initially add two trains from Guelph to Georgetown, where passengers could transfer into the existing GO service, said Greg Ashbee, GO Transit's manager of rail expansion programs.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It would be very significant&quot; if Guelph got GO service, said Rajan Philips, a transportation planner with the city.<br \/>    <br \/>    When GO Transit launched rail service to Barrie in December, the service was packed almost right away.<br \/>    <br \/>    But Guelph is a bit different, Philips said, because we don't have the same proportion of people leaving for work. The bigger trend here is the double-income family with one person working outside Guelph, often heading down Highway 401 to get there, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit offered rail service to Guelph from 1990 to 1993. It didn't do too well because it didn't offer commuters the option of staying at work later if they needed to, Ashbee said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;When there were cutbacks, you lop off the ends of the lines, especially in corridors that don't have significant ridership.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    It's unclear whether the city would have to pitch in for the service. None of the municipalities serviced by GO Transit pay operating costs, but they help pay for expansions to service. When GO came to Barrie, the city paid a third of the cost for the new station and for track improvements, Ashbee said.<br \/>    <br \/>    In the meantime, all stripes of politicians seem supportive of the potential for new service.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;There's a huge pent-up demand for commuter rail service to Toronto,&quot; said Mayor Karen Farbridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We're playing catch-up on work that didn't happen when it should have,&quot; Guelph MPP Liz Sandals said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It's something the provincial government should give serious consideration to given our population growth and the increasing number of people making the commute to Toronto,&quot; said Wellington-Halton Hills MPP Ted Arnott, who said it can take up to three hours for him to get to the legislature from his home in Fergus.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Notice of Study Commencement - Rail Service Expansion from Georgetown to Kitchener<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Guelph Mercury May 28, 2008 Page A8<br \/>    posted by waterloowarrior<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/wwuploads.googlepages.com\/gotransittokdub.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 06:28 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 06:35 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"3"},"323":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Committee wants to GO with Palvetzian's expertise<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Ray Martin Jun 13, 2008 - 12:00 AM<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/local\/article\/91546--committee-wants-to-go-with-palvetzian-s-expertise\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/lo...an-s-expertise<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Officials from the City of Cambridge will be assisting Waterloo Region's transportation planners put together a case for bringing GO bus and train service to the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    At Wednesday's economic development advisory committee (EDAC) meeting, planning commissioner Janet Babcock told the meeting that three senior members of city staff will be joining a regional steering committee tackling the issue.

And then it will be up to Waterloo Region and Cambridge to cover as much as a third of the capital cost to get the service started.<br \/>    <br \/>    Vincent told the advisory committee that's exactly what the City of Barrie is doing to have GO Transit extended there.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It only makes sense that they'd do the same thing here,&quot; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Before any expansion of the GO train system takes place, GO Transit has to address problems it has accommodating riders within the GTA. He noted that a track upgrade is needed from Union Station to Milton so that more trains can be added. Currently, the Milton trains are operating at 140 per cent of capacity and no more trains can be added.<br \/>    <br \/>    Meanwhile, Waterloo Region officials are looking at two alternatives to bringing GO trains into Waterloo Region. The first option is to use the VIA Rail connection through Guelph and Georgetown to Milton, while the second option is to use the CNR line connecting Milton to Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Vincent admitted the VIA Rail connection would do little to serve people in Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    As for GO bus service, Vincent said the region has been told that service could be implemented within the next year.<br \/>    <br \/>    Craig Bailey, a member of EDAC's GO Transit subcommittee believes immediate action is needed.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;The city should be setting aside money now for a GO station and talk with GO, that way we'll be ahead of the competition,&quot; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Vincent believes that GO bus service to the region will meet with only limited success because of growing traffic volumes on Highway 401. Without dedicated lanes the GO buses would face the same traffic delays as all other traffic heading to Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    Dedicated bus lanes will be a big part of Waterloo Region's proposed rapid transit plans, Vincent explained. The region will soon make a decision on whether it will be going with a rail or bus system for its new rapid transit system. While that decision will be made before the end of the year, the region is also looking at its long-range transit needs and is developing a master plan to meet those needs to the year 2031.<br \/>    <br \/>    After further discussion, members of EDAC have decided to investigate what it would take to have dedicated high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes instituted on Highway 401 in Waterloo Region. HOV lanes in the United States and cities like Toronto and Ottawa have helped reduce commuter traffic by making bus travel a faster, more reliable alternative.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 06:38 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 06:55 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"4"},"324":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">GO wants trains to Kitchener by 2011<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    September 25, 2008 <br \/>    Kevin Swayze, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO REGION<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/419977\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/419977<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/media.therecord.topscms.com\/images\/b0\/8a\/e45641554b00b4aec046f3145501.jpeg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    A GO Train crosses the Don Valley Parkway in Richmond Hill in this file photo from last January. <br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit wants to bring four passenger trains a day to Kitchener by 2011.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO officials expect a study now underway will bolster the case for the commuter-rail link with Toronto. The recommendations should be ready by March, Bruce Sevier, GO's senior projects officer, said yesterday.<br \/>    <br \/>    Design of a preferred route could start later in 2009 and, if financing comes through, construction of stations would start in 2010, he said. Trains could be running the next year.<br \/>    <br \/>    It depends on money, however. Sevier estimated the expansion would cost $40 million to $50 million, since GO would have to upgrade tracks and buy trains.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We don't know where the pot of gold might come from,&quot; he said in an interview, adding that this question hasn't been asked yet. But when GO extended rail service to Barrie last year, the capital cost was evenly shared by Queen's Park, the federal government and the City of Barrie. This could be the way financing is arranged for the Kitchener expansion, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    An environmental assessment now underway is looking at a route west from Georgetown along the former Canadian National tracks.<br \/>    <br \/>    The GO train proposal for Kitchener is up for public comment tonight during an information session at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, 54 Queen St. N. Doors will be open from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ken Seiling, the Waterloo Region chair, cautioned yesterday that local residents shouldn't get excited about boarding GO trains anytime soon.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It's not a given that it's going to happen,&quot; said Seiling, who has been lukewarm to the idea of expansion. &quot;What GO is saying is they would like it to happen. It's in the very early stages.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    In the past, Seiling has expressed concerns that GO train service would turn Waterloo Region into a bedroom community of the Toronto area.<br \/>    <br \/>    The 2006 census found 10,665 people commute daily between Waterloo Region and the Toronto area. Another 12,480 region residents head to Wellington County to work, and 9,465 Wellington County residents head to the region to work daily.<br \/>    <br \/>    Go officials are talking about adding bus service to Waterloo Region as early as next year.<br \/>    <br \/>    The area under study for GO trains follows the Goderich and Exeter railway -- formerly Canadian National -- as far west as Baden. There is no suggestion passengers could board trains in Baden, however. Downtown Kitchener would be the station farthest west. The tracks to the west of the city are included because they might be needed for parking trains overnight, Sevier said.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO service to downtown Kitchener would also link to the rapid transit system proposed for Waterloo Region. The Kitchener station is one of the likely stops on the rapid transit route, Sevier said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Today, Via Rail offers the only passenger train service to the region -- three trains a day into Kitchener. Via is studying upgrading the tracks it uses between Kitchener and Georgetown, along with modernizing the &quot;archaic&quot; signal system, Sevier said. It is also looking at boosting the number of trains it runs through Kitchener, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO is talking to Via about the upgrades, which would allow more trains to travel faster, he said. Some stretches of track have speed limits of 16 kilometres an hour. By comparison, trains using GO's Lakeshore and Barrie tracks top 100 km\/h.<br \/>    <br \/>    While Kitchener's GO train expansion appears on the fast track, a long-proposed westward extension from Milton to Cambridge is less certain, Seiling said. Regional council has approved a business case study of using the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to run passenger trains into south Cambridge. The cost and ridership study is expected to be done next year.<br \/>    <br \/>    Today, there's a bottleneck to expanding GO service west from Milton, Seiling said. The tracks between Milton and Toronto need to be upgraded to deal with today's demands. GO says Milton trains are running at 140 per cent capacity now; there's no way to handle more passengers without a huge capital investment.<br \/>    <br \/>    The region's Cambridge-Milton study would lay the groundwork for such an expansion whenever the Milton crunch is resolved, Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Looking at GO Transit<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Updated Fri.

The property, between Fountain Street and East Woolwich Road, is the site of the former Breslau Hotel.<br \/>    <br \/>    The commuter line also proposes a downtown station running parallel to Victoria Street for about three city blocks, near the Via Rail station. This would be an urban station, with little parking space and intended for cyclists, pedestrians and people connecting from other public transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    The downtown station plans could be changed, GO officials said, to create an all-in-one terminal linking up with the region's proposed rapid transit line connecting Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo. &quot;That's definitely part of the plan,&quot; said Greg Ashbee, GO's manager of environmental assessment and planning infrastructure. &quot;You don't want people walking for blocks to get from one to the other.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Under the GO proposal, the most western commuter station would be north of the existing tracks near Ira Needles Boulevard, along Glasgow Street. This would also be a car-friendly park-and-ride station like the one in Breslau.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional Chair Ken Seiling said council is fully behind the GO plans. An efficient intercity commuter service could be a boost for the local economy, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some local employers, particularly in the hi-tech sector, are struggling to find staff because there's no easy commute into the region.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;An improved rail service really helps employment opportunities within the region,&quot; Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    And the region's economy has grown enough that there are nearly as many people commuting into the region for work as those heading out, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;We don't think we're as much at risk of being a bedroom community as we were 10 years ago.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    GO's own passenger projections seem to support this. Based on population levels and job-related commuting statistics, the projections suggest that in 2011 there could be as many as 2,450 riders coming into the region on GO trains every day and about 2,600 going out.<br \/>    <br \/>    By 2031 there could as many as 7,800 commuters taking GO into Waterloo Region and about 7,900 riders taking the trains east, according to projections.<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed expansion plans were welcomed by a mostly enthusiastic crowd at a downtown church hall in Kitchener last night.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;I think it just makes sense,&quot; said Kitchener's Scott Ritchie. &quot;We're not a small city anymore. We need this.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    GO plans to have a preferred design for the Kitchener expansion sorted out by the end of January.<br \/>    <br \/>    By April, it wants to have an environmental assessment report submitted to the government, and start a 45-day period for public input.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Support GO link, then build on it<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    September 26, 2008 <br \/>    THE RECORD<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/420230\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/420230<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    The news that GO Transit intends to give Kitchener a commuter-train link to Toronto by 2011 is fantastic.<br \/>    <br \/>    Everyone who's ever been wedged between two transports travelling at 120 km\/h on that asphalt pressure cooker known as the 401 east of here will have cause to celebrate. Every one of the 23,000 commuters who drive from Waterloo Region to Wellington County and the Greater Toronto Area each day can shout &quot;Hooray.''<br \/>    <br \/>    As for us, we say, good for GO. It's about time. And it should only be the beginning. GO trains to Kitchener will meet only part of this region's transit needs -- there's Cambridge and the south to think about as well as a rapid transit system within the region itself.<br \/>    <br \/>    But let's start by accentuating the positive. This growing, dynamic community has needed better transit links to Toronto for years. Each day, 10,700 regional residents travel from Waterloo Region to Toronto, Halton and Peel regions to work. In addition, each day 12,480 people travel from Waterloo Region to Wellington County to do their jobs.<br \/>    <br \/>    All that travel puts a huge burden on Ontario's already overstressed road system. It burns enormous amounts of gasoline. It pumps more greenhouse, climate-altering gases into the atmosphere. It exacts a toll, too, on the nerves of all those commuters.<br \/>    <br \/>    It's true there are alternatives to automobiles: Greyhound runs 23 buses out of Kitchener to Toronto daily. Via rail offers three trains a day to Kitchener. But those buses spend too much time stuck in traffic on the 401 with all the other cars. And those Via trains simply don't cut it as viable commuter connections. Given all this, its hardly surprising that the latest studies seem to confirm the need for a commuter train to Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    At one time, the regional government's official policy opposed a GO link because it was feared it could turn Waterloo Region into a bedroom community for Toronto. The region has wisely abandoned that policy and currently supports a GO connection. That's good because the region will almost certainly have to back up its commitment with money.<br \/>    <br \/>    And this, in fact, is the rub. The trains aren't running yet -- and will only start running in 2011 if and when various government treasuries agree to spend up to $50 million on the project. There should be no doubt, no hesitation, no equivocation that GO trains are the kind of safe, fast, reliable, economical and environmentally-positive way to move people that this region, this province and this country need to embrace.<br \/>    <br \/>    It is imperative that people in this region speak with one voice in their firm support for this GO train. They should be able to look to the regional government to make a strong financial commitment to a GO project. They should look to their elected representatives in the federal and provincial governments to press for the money needed to make a commuting dream into a reality.<br \/>    <br \/>    At the same time, no one should forget the even greater need for a rapid transit system connecting the region's three cities that would offer a better alternative to the car for the 190,000 people who live in the region and work in it each day. Nor can the needs of Cambridge be overlooked. That growing city, which has long harboured dreams of a GO train for itself, also has thousands of commuters travelling on the 401 daily. If those Cambridge residents and taxpayers are to be expected to financially support a GO train to Kitchener, they should in turn be able to count on continued regionwide support for a GO link to Cambridge. In addition, if the Kitchener link does come first, ways should be found to make it as convenient as possible for Cambridge residents to use.<br \/>    <br \/>    The news this week is wonderful. There is still a huge amount of work to be done -- and miles to travel before that first rail commute.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 07:04 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 07:14 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"5"},"325":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GO Georgetown to KW EA PIC #1 Document:<\/font><\/font><\/b> <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/steve.hostovsky.com\/14877_Kitchener_Guelph_Rail%20Expansion_PIC_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/steve.hostovsky.com\/14877_Kit...sion_PIC_1.pdf<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GO Transit may get going via VIA Rail<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    December 02, 2008 <br \/>    Nicole O'Reilly, Mercury staff - GUELPH<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/news.guelphmercury.com\/News\/article\/411049\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.guelphmercury.com\/News\/article\/411049<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Of the three proposed GO Transit sites in Guelph, city staff are recommending council endorse the downtown Via Rail station.<br \/>    <br \/>    But parking concerns may turn out to be the thorn in its side.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Via site was among the proposed locations brought forward at a public meeting held by GO Transit in September. The former Lafarge property off the Hanlon Expressway and at Watson Road in the east end are also on the table.<br \/>    <br \/>    If all goes according to plan, trains could start stopping on the Kitchener to Toronto route in 2011.<br \/>    <br \/>    But the ultimate decision where Guelph's stop or stops end up comes down to GO Transit, city engineer Richard Henry said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;Places to Grow identified the downtown as one of the growth nodes,&quot; he said, adding the city is also looking at moving its downtown bus hub to the Via location from St. George's Square.<br \/>    <br \/>    Because the station is already built, Henry said, the Via location has the least environmental impact and is the most cost-effective.<br \/>    <br \/>    The GO Transit team is conducting an environmental assessment, with plans to hold a second public meeting to determine the preferred site in January or February. Although GO is considering two Guelph locations, Henry said the city has indicated that there will be one station for initial service.<br \/>    <br \/>    Most fully functioning GO Transit stations have 800 to 1,000 parking spaces, Leonard Rach, the project manager from R.J. Burnside and Associates Ltd. said during the September public meeting.<br \/>    <br \/>    But starting with only four trains each morning and evening, Guelph is projected to need 210 parking spaces for the initial phase of service. While it is too early for details, Henry said the city is certainly aware that parking needs to be fully examined.<br \/>    <br \/>    With the proposed Wilson Street garage set to be open before train service starts, the idea is that its public availability would open other downtown spaces for GO riders.<br \/>    <br \/>    Whether this means riders will park on the street or use an existing lot, if it will be free for riders and even if the spots will be reserved is all yet to be determined with GO Transit, Henry said.<br \/>    <br \/>    One of the resolutions would be to open a second station if downtown parking reaches beyond capacity.<br \/>    <br \/>    But David Graham, a longtime advocate for improved rail transit, said it may be too late.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;The downtown is a wonderful spot, but it's not enough,&quot; he said, adding GO Transit should have used the Via location and former Lafarge property from the outset.<br \/>    <br \/>    Graham pointed to the Barrie GO train service that restarted last December as an example of what will likely go wrong in Guelph.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;They expected 150 people, but on the first day 280 showed up . . . within three months the lot was full,&quot; he said, adding it is already planning expansion.<br \/>    <br \/>    Graham thinks the Lafarge property should be snapped up now, before Silvercreek Guelph Developments sees the now vacant property developed into commercial outlets. &quot;The boat on Lafarge is close to leaving,&quot; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">City on GO Transit&#8217;s radar<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Ray Martin, Times Staff Jan 20, 2009 - 12:00 AM<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/local\/article\/108664--city-on-go-transit-s-radar\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cambridgetimes.ca\/news\/lo...ransit-s-radar<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge is a small step closer to getting GO Transit. During a meeting of EDAC (Economic Development Advisory Committee), member Craig Bailey said GO Transit is looking at creating a bus link to Cambridge using the commuter parking lot on the east side of Townline Road as a bus stop. <br \/>    In talking with a GO Transit official, Bailey said a bus loop could be created from Guelph to Kitchener and then swing down Highway 8 to Highway 401 through Cambridge. It will then head back to Milton and connect with the existing GO Train service into that city.<br \/>    <br \/>    Bailey said Waterloo Region officials have pushed for GO Transit, but not specifically for Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The only reason we are on the list is because the mayor and our committee have kept pushing for it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And we will continue pushing.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    In mid-December, the provincial transit system unveiled GO 2020, a new strategic plan which includes the extension of bus or rail services to St. Catharines, Niagara Falls, Brantford, Kitchener, Waterloo, Cambridge, Guelph and Peterborough.

GO would at first use the Via Rail station, then relocate to King Street to join with local rail transit. <br \/>    <br \/>    Commuter rail to and from Toronto could arrive by 2011, but only if the provincial government agrees to fund the proposal.

But he cautioned that his government would have to weigh the cost against other priorities. &quot;The timing is tied to dollars,&quot; said Milloy. &quot;You could see buses as an interim step.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    GO has dismissed buses in its proposal, calling them less attractive than trains and inefficient without dedicated transit lanes.<br \/>    <br \/>    The latest plans were released at a Kitchener information centre.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO proposes four trains in the morning rush and four trains in the afternoon rush. Getting to Toronto would take 90 minutes. Fares are undetermined. Buses would run in the middle hours at first. Eventually, trains would run every 20 minutes in peak times and less frequently in-between.<br \/>    <br \/>    The latest plan differs from a preliminary proposal last year. GO has incorporated feedback and studied environmental and property impacts. Among the changes:<br \/>    <br \/>    The agency no longer favours a park-and-ride station in Breslau, due partly to traffic concerns.<br \/>    <br \/>    The agency no longer favours a park-and-ride station on Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener.

Plan B would be to park trains at Baden, near Sandhills Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    Plan C could see trains parked overnight at Petersburg.

But he also warns that the Liberal government, which has the final say, will have to weigh the undisclosed cost against other priorities.<br \/>    <br \/>    Milloy does not decide transit spending. He is minister for colleges and universities. But when cabinet ministers talk about spending choices, it's wise to listen.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;The idea usually is to begin with buses and then build up the capacity,&quot; Milloy told me at a public meeting on GO service.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;So that would be the next logical step.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    He then said: &quot;The usual route would be to go with the bus service as an interim step.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    This was followed by: &quot;A potential interim step would be buses.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Finally, he said: &quot;Between now and trains, you could see buses as an interim step.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Let me speculate. Perhaps the province will send buses rather than trains. Perhaps this will be billed as an interim step.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO has done this elsewhere. It's also a way for governments to let people down easily. We can't afford trains, but here's some buses to show we still care.<br \/>    <br \/>    Problem is, it's pointless.<br \/>    <br \/>    The GO study that's looking at Kitchener does not recommend buses as a logical interim step. It recommends against them.<br \/>    <br \/>    Increased bus service is part of solution, but less efficient and attractive than rail service for specific downtown Toronto-oriented commuter market. Will not be efficient without dedicated transit lanes. Not recommended.<br \/>    <br \/>    We already have commuter buses to Toronto. They're called Greyhound. They run all the time from downtown Kitchener and from a park-and-ride station near Highway 401.<br \/>    <br \/>    Disgruntled Greyhound passengers may want the competition. Perhaps GO buses would offer cheaper fares, subsidized by taxpayers.<br \/>    <br \/>    But it's hard to see how GO buses would be a big step forward. Do we really want to spend public funds to compete with a viable private service?<br \/>    <br \/>    GO trains are more promising. The proposed schedule (four morning trains and four evening trains) is far more commuter-friendly than Via Rail, which has a poor schedule.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO buses would do little for commuters. My advice to the province is, extend rail service to Kitchener or do nothing. GO trains or go home.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Harper, McGuinty announce $500M boost for GO <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Last Updated: Tuesday, February 17, 2009 | 12:44 PM ET <br \/>    CBC News (With files from the Canadian Press) - <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/canada\/toronto\/story\/2009\/02\/17\/transit.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/canada\/toronto\/sto...7\/transit.html<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit is getting a $500 million boost as part of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's economic action plan.<br \/>    <br \/>    Harper told reporters about the funding at a press conference held with Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty in Toronto Tuesday.<br \/>    <br \/>    The money appears to be a reannouncement of funding previously committed in 2008 under the Building Canada Fund, which critics say the government has been slow to spend.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ontario has been hit hard by the economic downturn and such investments will create jobs and prepare the province to maintain its place as the &quot;bastion&quot; of the national economy, Harper said on Tuesday.<br \/>    <br \/>    The money will cover more than a dozen projects across the region and help the GO Transit system &quot;handle the huge increases in ridership that are projected throughout the Golden Horseshoe during the next decade,&quot; Harper said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some of the money will go toward improving parking at 12 GO stations, from Mississauga to Markham and to Pickering, said McGuinty.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Hamilton GO junction, which has been a major site of congestion, will get a $75 million upgrade, he added.<br \/>    <br \/>    Improved transit means less gridlock, and less gridlock means a stronger economy in the long run, said McGuinty.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;With better service, people can pursue new job opportunities or training opportunities because they have a transit connection that gets them there,&quot; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;When transit is more convenient, more people leave their car at home, and that means cleaner air and a healthier environment for all of us.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    About 200,000 people in the Toronto area use GO Transit's network of buses and trains daily.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GO Transit layover station on the move again<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    By Doug Coxson, Independent Staff - Mar 18, 2009 <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.newhamburgindependent.ca\/news\/article\/167298\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.newhamburgindependent.ca\/news\/article\/167298<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit will wrap up its year-long study to expand service between Georgetown and Kitchener next month, but not before going back to the public with a new location for a train layover station. <br \/>    The commuter rail service is now proposing a layover facility just north of the Wilmot Recreation Complex on Nafziger Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    A public information centre has been scheduled at the WRC on Tuesday, March 24 from 6 p. m. to 9 p. m. for residents to drop in, see plans and voice an opinion.<br \/>    <br \/>    Previous layover station sites were proposed in Petersburg and on Sandhills Road in Baden, but both those ideas are now off the table, said GO Transit&#8217;s manager of infrastructure expansion planning Greg Ashbee.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ashbee said GO Transit became convinced the new site fits in better with their plans because of it lies within the township&#8217;s designated industrial area, the site is easily accessed from Nafziger Road and there are no immediate neighbours of the facility.<br \/>    <br \/>    Alpine Plant Foods Corp is directly across Nafziger. A home and barn is about 300 metres to the north of the tracks. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It fits in with with overall plans of the township and the region,&#8221; he said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Layover stations provide a compound and shelter where trains are parked and fueled overnight, and on weekends. The compounds typically feature an above-ground fuel tank and pumps, electrical hook ups for the trains, as well as floodlights, several cameras and alarms to deter vandalism.<br \/>    <br \/>    Trains are set to idle about an hour before the train goes into service in order to bring it up to operational speed.<br \/>    <br \/>    In light of the possibility of adding a future boarding station on the west side of Kitchener, Ashbee said GO Transit would likely want to reserve the right to expand the layover facility to build service bays and a below-ground walkway, allowing workers to move underneath the trains to perform regular maintenance and repairs.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ashbee said potential issues for neighbours of the facility are the noise impact from idling trains in the morning and light pollution from the yard at night.<br \/>    <br \/>    Despite hearing concerns throughout the EA process, positive response to the expansion plan has come from various members of the community.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wilmot Township&#8217;s director of development services Harold O&#8217;Krafka was one of the first to endorse GO Transit&#8217;s initiative last June, urging the transit service provider to consider building a station in Wilmot to serve the growing community while catering to residents living on the west side of the cities.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;A Go Transit station in the vicinity of Nafziger Road would provide significant opportunity to reduce vehicle traffic on both Highway 7 and 8 and also the 401 corridor by improving access to public transit without having to drive to downtown Kitchener or Stratford to access those stations,&#8221; O&#8217;Krafka wrote in his report to council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Although he&#8217;s still concerned that GO&#8217;s plans not to build a station on the west side of Kitchener will prevent local commuters from using the service, he&#8217;s hopeful the new location of the layover facility will increase the potential for a west-side station in the future.<br \/>    <br \/>    It could also mean a future passenger boarding station in Wilmot.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It has the potential to be a really important thing for the community,&#8221; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    For the most part, Ashbee agrees.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;If Kitchener develops the way I think it will, a few years from now we&#8217;ll probably be adding another station on the west side of Ki t c h e n e r,&#8221; Ashbee said. &#8220;But the way I like to think of it is &#8212; it&#8217;s a big leap for us to get to Kitchener, let&#8217;s get there first.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    The possibility of one day converting the layover station into a passenger boarding station is not in the forecast, but Ashbee doesn&#8217;t want to rule the idea out.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit does have layover yards next to stations but it requires much more space and track infrastructure. He said it&#8217;s also preferable to provide layover facilities beyond the last passenger station because of potential impacts to train schedules in relation to the time it takes to switch controls as train directions change.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Baden layover station does provide potential for other stations to come online between Wilmot Township and downtown Kitchener, Ashbee said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The current service model for GO Transit has the majority of riders from outlying cities traveling to Toronto and back with very few getting off at stops in between.<br \/>    <br \/>    But previous public information centres throughout the EA study made it clear to GO Transit officials that local riders will be making more trips between Kitchener and Guelph than anticipated.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;For GO that&#8217;s a new market,&#8221; said Ashbee. &#8220;A local commuter market is something we haven&#8217;t really satisfied before.<br \/>    <br \/>    I think it&#8217;s going to be a real success story but time will tell.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Ashbee said the proposed expansion is still dependent on Ministry of Transportation approval and provincial funding.<br \/>    <br \/>    The optimistic timeline for that to fall into place is 2011.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GO Transit mulls overnight layover site outside of city<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    March 23, 2009 <br \/>    Jeff Outhit, RECORD STAFF - NEW HAMBURG<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/508009\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/508009<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    There's a new development in a study to extend GO Transit commuter trains to Kitchener by 2011.

The site is industrial, far from residences but close to New Hamburg's new recreation complex.<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit has also looked at parking trains in Petersburg or Baden, but some neighbours were concerned.

The purchase is valued at C$160 million.<br \/>        <br \/>    GO currently runs its Georgetown commuter rail service over the line, which also accommodates VIA Rail trains running between Toronto, Kitchener, and other points in southwestern Ontario. In total, the two passenger carriers operate 46 trains per day over the line, while CN operates three daily local freight trains along this corridor.<br \/>    <br \/>    Under its agreement with GO Transit, CN will continue to serve its freight customers on the Weston Subdivision. VIA will also continue to operate trains on the line.<br \/>    <br \/>    By owning the Georgetown rail corridor, GO is better positioned to add more service, build new infrastructure, and expand its operations along that line. This acquisition aligns with GO Transit's Strategic Plan, GO 2020.<br \/>        <br \/>    &quot;This is a major step forward for future growth and expansion along this already busy corridor,&quot; said GO Transit Chairman Peter Smith. &quot;This purchase sets the framework for future GO rail corridor purchases, and we look forward to continuing our strong, long-standing partnership with CN.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Claude Mongeau, CN executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said: &quot;CN is pleased to have reached this line-sale agreement with GO Transit. GO is a valuable CN customer - the vast majority of its services in the Greater Toronto Area operate over CN's rail network - and we believe this transaction and our continuing partnership with GO will help to advance commuter rail and its clear environmental benefits to the Toronto region.

The plan is not finalized and is without provincial funding.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wilmot Township supports parking trains at Nafziger Road and hopes the industrial site may eventually become a station. &quot;If they're going to locate in Wilmot Township, we feel that's the ideal location,&quot; said Harold O'Krafka, Wilmot's director of development.","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 07:56 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 08:05 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"9"},"329":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100524204935im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 1,647","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Existing Conditions - Natural and Social Environments (April 2009):<\/font><\/font><\/b> <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.gotransit.com\/PUBLIC\/en\/news\/ea\/georgetown-kitchener\/VolumeI_Figures\/N-Figures.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.gotransit.com\/PUBLIC\/en\/n...\/N-Figures.pdf<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Mayor won't take 'no' on GO <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Posted By DONAL O'CONNOR<br \/>    Stratford Beacon Herald - April 2009<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.stratfordbeaconherald.com\/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1533148\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.stratfordbeaconherald.com...aspx?e=1533148<\/a><br \/>      <br \/>    Stratford isn't in the defined study area for a GO Transit terminal, but Mayor Dan Mathieson plans to meet with Minister of Transportation Jim Bradley about parking GO trains here. <br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It's in our best interest, our long-term connectivity of the region and of course on to Toronto, that we look at attaining the rail yard within our community,&quot; the mayor said. <br \/>    <br \/>    He has already requested a meeting with Mr. Bradley, he said, and has made the city's intentions known to Perth-Wellington MPP John Wilkinson. <br \/>    <br \/>    Mayor Mathieson was reacting to a letter from Andreas Grammonz, project leader for the study that is currently mapping out an expansion plan that will add Kitchener to GO Transit's route. <br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;It is important to note that GO must operate within the scope of the current environmental assessment, which is limited to the study area west from Georgetown to Kitchener, and precludes evaluation of any sites outside of the study area,&quot; said Mr. Grammonz in his letter. <br \/>    <br \/>    The mayor said he understands Stratford will have to approach the transportation minister. <br \/>    <br \/>    He declined comment on a news report that some Baden-area residents have been voicing opposition to the study's preferred Nafziger Road site for parking and warming up trains that will serve Kitchener. <br \/>    <br \/>    Mayor Mathieson has been arguing the case for making use of Stratford's existing rail yard for parking and refuelling GO trains rather than investing in new rail infrastructure in the Baden-New Hamburg area.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">City pushes to bring GO yard to Stratford<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Tori Sutton, Staff Reporter - Stratford Gazette<br \/>    April 2009<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.stratfordgazette.com\/stratford\/article\/67246\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.stratfordgazette.com\/stratford\/article\/67246<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Mayor Dan Mathieson said the push to bring a GO Transit train layover yard to Stratford is gaining steam.<br \/>    <br \/>    In an interview earlier this week, Mathieson said his office has received plenty of positive feedback since last week&#8217;s public information session was held in Baden.<br \/>    <br \/>    But it&#8217;s not just locals who are keen to see Stratford rail yards used as the layover site &#8211; those in the Baden area are also supporting the move.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a number of (Baden) residents contact our office saying they support it and they don&#8217;t want the rail yard in their community,&#8221; Mathieson told the Gazette. &#8220;They feel it&#8217;s appropriate to use existing yards that are already in place and they&#8217;ve offered their support where necessary.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    GO Transit is proposing a trail layover site be established on the south side of the main line track between New Hamburg and Baden,  at Nafziger Road. The site is part of a plan to expand GO train service from Georgetown to Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    As well, the mayor said many people in the agricultural community &#8211; especially those who have been following the Highway 7\/8 corridor study &#8211; are happy to see the city advocating other modes of transportation.<br \/>    <br \/>    Though GO Transit has publicly stated Stratford was not included in its study area and therefore could not proceed with a layover site here, Mathieson disagrees.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I would say while that sounds like a very good answer, it&#8217;s not true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Baden was never included in the original study area either, and they expanded it when they ran into resistance in the City of Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;They&#8217;ve shown a flexibility to revise their study area when necessary.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    The city has requested a meeting with GO Transit senior officials and Ministry of Transportation (MTO) strategic planning staff, though a date has not yet been set.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;At the end of the day, senior officials at the MTO are responsible for the decision and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re taking a two-pronged approach,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;We&#8217;ll work with GO where necessary and we will definitely be pointing out to the officials at the MTO what we think is a flawed system.&#8221; <br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">GO should consider Stratford<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Letters - Apr 15, 2009 <br \/>    New Hamburg Independent<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.newhamburgindependent.ca\/opinions\/article\/170660\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.newhamburgindependent.ca\/...article\/170660<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    This letter was sent to GO Transit officials last week: <br \/>    Thank you for your ongoing efforts to provide effective transit service to communities in southwestern Ontario.<br \/>    <br \/>    I would like to comment on the current question of where to park the GO Trains overnight when the Georgetown to Kitchener service begins.<br \/>    <br \/>    I am aware of the current plan to park the trains just north of the Wilmot Recreation Complex between New Hamburg and Baden, and also of the residents&#8217; concerns about this plan.<br \/>    <br \/>    I realize that such concerns are not unusual in transit development, but I think that under the circumstances there are other options that GO planners might consider that would have short and long term benefits across an area from Baden west to Stratford.<br \/>    <br \/>    I am referring of course to the Stratford Mayor&#8217;s invitation to GO Transit to park their trains overnight on an existing rail yard in Stratford. Given the existence of this facility and the fact that it needs only modest upgrades, the cost saving against a site in New Hamburg with no pre-existing facilities would appear to be substantial.<br \/>    <br \/>    Of course, if there is no clear evidence of likely ridership in the Stratford-KW-Toronto corridor, then parking overnight in Stratford would make little economic or planning sense.<br \/>    <br \/>    However, as you are aware, highway-use data on the 7 and 8 corridor<br \/>    <br \/>    between New Hamburg and Stratford is being presented as sufficiently high to warrant a major expansion of that highway. It is hard to conclude that at least some of that traffic could not be diverted to a public transit option if it was affordable, frequent and convenient.<br \/>    <br \/>    For the above reasons, I am encouraging you to consider the Stratford overnight option with the possibility of offering actual GO passenger service in Stratford, Shakespeare and<br \/>    <br \/>    Baden\/New Hamburg in the near future. I think the support from the local communities for such a venture might prove to be surprisingly strong.<br \/>    <br \/>    Thank you for your consideration of these ideas.<br \/>    <br \/>    Rick Cober Bauman, Shakespeare","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100524204935\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=460\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 460\"><b><font size=\"2\"><font color=\"green\">WW Meet 2: Saturday May 29 4-7 PM<\/font><\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-03-2010 08:06 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"01-03-2010 08:19 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"10"}}},"75":{"parent_forums":[{"forum_id":"15","forum_name":"Food, Retail, Entertainment and Recreation"},{"forum_id":"17","forum_name":"Food and Dining"}],"title":"King Street Trio Uptown | Opens Early November","description":"King Street Trio Uptown    40 King Street South, Waterloo    Website | Architect        http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Food\/King%20Street%20Trio\/kingstreet_04.jpg                    40 King St. South is on the East side of King st. just to the left of the train tracks.  #40 is where the Paper Tree used to be.

Waterloo Mayor Brenda Halloran went from voting in favour of light rail at regional council in June 2009 to vocally questioning the costs and routes.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI think the whole reason we kind of came together to organize this kind of collaborative demonstration in support of the LRT is a lot of the rhetoric leading up to October\u2019s elections,\u201d Mackenzie Keast, of the student planning advisory, said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThere is a lot of negativity toward the LRT, a lot of outspoken members of the community had expressed their anti-LRT position and a lot of the local councillors were publicly speaking out against the LRT,\u201d Keast said.<br \/>    <br \/>    In June 2009 regional council voted overwhelmingly in favour of the light-rail plans. Then the provincial government committed $300 million to the project and the federal government announced $265 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    That leaves $225 million in costs the region must cover. Regional planners are preparing a report that will be tabled in January with options to reduce costs.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Sunday rally was deliberately scheduled to occur the day before the first meeting of the new city council in Waterloo and elsewhere.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cSo we are hoping it\u2019s going to be kind of fresh on their minds and show them, hey: \u2018Yes you have spoken to a lot of people that are against the LRT, there have been a lot of very vocal opponents to the LRT, but look at all these people who have come out to show that they are in favour,\u201d Keast said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Halloran said Waterloo city council will not be passing a motion to oppose the planned light-rail system.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cBut we have to look at all the options,\u201d Halloran said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s about the costs and how much taxpayers can bear.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    But Halloran said she does not want to be characterized as being opposed to the light-rail plans either.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI don\u2019t want to present it that: \u2018Oh she\u2019s against it,\u2019 and then I will get all this hate mail from the LRT guys, which I am starting to get anyway,\u201d Halloran said.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe have to be open to the possibilities of new options based on the funding that we have in place now,\u201d Halloran said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Mark Whaley, who represented the City of Waterloo on the region\u2019s transportation master plan committee where he supported the light-rail plans, said he is rethinking that position because of the short fall in capital funding.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cAnd <b>what I mean by rethinking is unclear even in my mind<\/b>, but I don\u2019t think based on the fact that there is a quarter-of-a-billion dollar shortfall on the money that we can just go blindly forward with the plan we had before without <b>some kind of consultation with the public again<\/b>,\u201d Whaley said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Whaley said he has no intentions at this time to introduce a motion at Waterloo city council in opposition to the region\u2019s plans for light rail.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> Sigh... <img src=\"\/web\/20101209015949im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/Package1\/RpS_sad.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"RpS Sad\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/>","signature":"","date":"11-30-2010 08:11 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"20122":{"user":{"name":"DHLawrence","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 341    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 74","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Could have been worse; at least Outhit didn't write it.","signature":"","date":"11-30-2010 05:58 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"8"},"20127":{"user":{"name":"benjaminbach","avatar":null,"title":"Village Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Oct 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 63    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 54","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"Out of curiosity, whats the specific objection to what Brenda and Mark said in the article?<br \/>   <br \/>   One can be in favour of better &amp; expanded transit while still thinking the current plan is too expensive\/not innovative enough (note: I'm not trying to put words in Brenda or Mark's mouth)","signature":"","date":"11-30-2010 07:16 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"9"},"20134":{"user":{"name":"IEFBR14","avatar":"\/web\/20101209015949im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=177&amp;dateline=1283110420","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Mar 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation H2OWC    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 743    \t\t\t\t\t\tUrban Reward Points 244","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20101209015949im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>benjaminbach<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20101209015949\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=20127#post20127\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20101209015949im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">Out of curiosity, whats the specific objection to what Brenda and Mark said in the article?<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> Brenda's speaking out of both sides of her mouth as she did during the election campaign.

The federal and provincial governments have committed $565 million, leaving a $235- million tab for the region.<br \/>   <br \/>   Face with growing opposition, many regional politicians distanced themselves from the plan during the October election.<br \/>   <br \/>   Sunday&#8217;s rally was organized by Tri-Cities Transport Action Group, the website Wonderful Waterloo and the University of Waterloo Students Planning Advisory.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;(We) chose to organize the Rally for Rails to get over a lot of the fear, uncertainty and doubt that&#8217;s being spread by the opposition,&#8221; said Mollison, an executive member of the Tri-Cities Transport Action Group.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We want to make sure that the lies about LRT are really righted.&#8221; T h o s e &#8220; l i e s &#8221; include the claim that rail transit is more expensive in the l o n g - r u n , Mo l l i s o n said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;The most expensive alternative is to build more roads and to buy buses &#8212; the vehicles don&#8217;t last as long, you use more drivers to move the same amount of people,&#8221; he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;What you end up with is congestion.&#8221; According to pamphlets TriTAG handed out during the rally, the cost of building roads to accommodate the same number of motorists that the LRT hopes to get in ridership will cost a billion dollars more than the LRT system&#8217;s impact on regional taxpayers.<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s part of a concerted effort to get rid of the perception that most people are opposed to LRT, said Andrew Hilliard of Wonderful Waterloo.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;After the election, there were a number of politicians who were questioning the cost of the system,&#8221; Hilliard said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We decided to hold a rally to show local councils there is support.&#8221; Support for the project is high among students, said Mackenzie Keast, president of the University of Waterloo Students Planning Advisory.<br \/>   <br \/>   With the growth expected in the region, a rapid transit system will be vital, the fourth-year UW planning student said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We have 300,000 more people moving to this region before 2031,&#8221; Keast said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Transit riders are already experiencing packed buses on the routes around the universities, he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Can you imagine the No. 7 or the iXpress 10 years from now?&#8221; &#8220;If those people aren&#8217;t coming to the cores of our region, if economic development isn&#8217;t stimulated around a spine of LRT, they&#8217;re going to move out to the suburban areas.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Twenty-five new Hespeler Roads are going to have to be built by 2031 if we don&#8217;t have LRT.&#8221; L o c a l politicians who support rapid transit also took the opportunity to push the LRT during the rally.<br \/>   <br \/>   The LRT isn&#8217;t just about the state of the region right now, but the future, Seiling said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We took a look at what was going on around us in the GTA and we decided we wanted to leave a better legacy for our children,&#8221;

You're quoted as saying &#8220;If I had to hazard a guess, there were more Region of Waterloo public relations staff at the rally than there were Waterloo ratepayers.&#8221; As someone who was at the rally, I'd like to say that your comments are completely false. There were certainly more ratepayers at the rally who actually care about the future of the Region as a whole, rather than short-term thinking politicians.<br \/>    Politicians are the ones who have to make important and tough decisions about the future of our communities. They should be educated on issues. Most councillors, including yourself, seem to have hopped on the opposition bandwagon simply because the public has voiced opposition to the project. I'm hoping that you will educate yourself on the issue of LRT in Waterloo Region, and make an informed decision, rather than listening solely to the largely uneducated public.<br \/>    I hope that you will stop spreading false information.<br \/>    Waterloo Ratepayer<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b>His Response:<\/b><br \/>    I don't normally respond to unsigned notes but I'll make an exception in your case John Z.<br \/>    <br \/>    For the past four years I was Waterloo's representative on the Regional Transportation Master Plan Committee and attended most meetings as we laid out a plan for the future transportation needs of this Region to 2031.  No Waterloo member of Regional Council attended any of the meetings as I recall.  I voted in favour of the plan as adopted which moves this area towards a transit oriented future.<br \/>    <br \/>    In my personal life our family has scaled down to using one car and we most frequently use our bikes in summertime.  I often walk to work year round.  We don't use transit because we choose to live in the core of the city within walking distance of most of our needs.  I have been an environmental and social activist in this community for many decades and have received such  recognition as the Waterloo Award, Canadian Urban Leadership Award and the June Callwood Award for Volunteerism among other accolades that have punctuated my commitment to quality of life issues in my community. <br \/>    <br \/>    The article in the newspaper was an honest response to the questions that were posed by the reporter. It was not false information in my opinion. My own position on LRT has shifted from qualified support, (when other levels of government promised capital funding,) to a wait and see attitude as the Region devises a new strategy based on the new funding model that presents itself.  Local reporters who have interviewed me are aware of my stance on this issue but do not include it in their stories.<br \/>    <br \/>     <br \/>    As I said John, I do not usually rise to the bait of unsigned emails.  But I appreciate the opportunity to give clarity to my position with respect to the article you found so offensive.<br \/>    <br \/>    Respectfully,<br \/>    <br \/>     <br \/>    <br \/>    Mark Whaley<br \/>    <br \/>    Councillor Ward 5 <br \/>    <br \/>    City of Waterloo<br \/>    <br \/>    t: (519) 747-8784<br \/>    <br \/>    c: (519) 635-9436<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20101210223257\/http:\/\/www.waterloo.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.waterloo.ca<\/a>","signature":"","date":"12-08-2010 08:16 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"80"}}},"85":{"parent_forums":[{"forum_id":"11","forum_name":"Regional Economy and Politics"},{"forum_id":"12","forum_name":"Economy"}],"title":"Grand River Hospital","description":"Grand River Hospital    835 King St. West &amp; 3570 King St. East, Kitchener    www.grandriverhospital.on.ca    http:\/\/www.grhf.org\/    http:\/\/www.grhf.org\/_grrcc\/new_site\/        http:\/\/www.grandriverhospital.on.ca\/images\/logo-grh-home.gif        About Grand River Hospital    Grand River Hospital is a 495 bed comprehensive community hospital that provides patient-centered care to more than 450,000 residents in the Region of Waterloo and the surrounding communities.

Seventy patients were cared for in its first year. The 30-bed facility had one operating room, a handful of nurses, and a dozen physicians. The hospital's School of Nursing opened the following year and trained more than 1400 nurses before closing 80 years later. <br \/>    Freeport Hospital first began as a tuberculosis sanatorium. Following medical advances and altered treatment of tuberculosis after World War II, Freeport began admitting chronic care and rehabilitation patients. It was the first facility in the province to initiate a move into this direction of care. During the 1960s, the need for chronic care beds continued to grow resulting in the addition of more beds, and by 1970 the Freeport Sanatorium became Freeport Hospital. <br \/>    While Grand River Hospital has a rich history of quality care-giving, we believe our future will be even more impressive. Your community hospital will provide new and expanded services to our rapidly growing community's health care needs. During the next few years, we look forward to offering the following:<ul><li>A new inpatient oncology unit with an increase of six patient beds<\/li>   <li>A new ambulatory care centre<\/li>   <li>A new mental health unit which includes, a crisis assessment facility, day hospital and child and adolescent inpatient psychiatry unit<\/li>   <li>A new, spacious intensive care unit with an additional 8 patient beds<\/li>   <li>A new brachytherapy surgical suite to treat appropriate cancer patients by administering radiation internally<\/li>   <li>A new and expanded fracture clinic<\/li>   <\/ul><b>2008 - 2009 Community Update:<\/b> <a href=\"\/web\/20100826064640\/http:\/\/www.grhf.org\/GRH_Annual_08-09_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.grhf.org\/GRH_Annual_08-09_FINAL.pdf<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Revenue: 281,036,000<br \/>    <u>Expenses: 281,539,000<\/u><br \/>    Surplus (Deficit) from Operations (503,000)<br \/>    Building Grants and Donations 6,181,000<br \/>    <u>Building Amortization (7,066,000)<\/u><br \/>    Hospital Surplus (Deficit) $ (1,388,000)<br \/>    <br \/>    Admissions:  21,971 <br \/>    Births: 4,297<br \/>    Day surgery visits:  12,715 <br \/>    Emergency visits: 57,445<br \/>    Ambulatory care visits: 201,681<br \/>    Full and Part-Time Staff: 2983<br \/>    Medical Staff: 556","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100826064640\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=513\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Wonderful Waterloo - Thread 513\"><b><font color=\"green\">Livable Waterloo Region | Saturday August 21, 2010<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-06-2010 11:26 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"1"},"3416":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20100826064640im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener-Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 2,476","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">GRH approves budget<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    570 News Mar 23, 2010 15:16:57 PM - <a href=\"\/web\/20100826064640\/http:\/\/www.570news.com\/news\/local\/article\/38432--grh-approves-budget\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.570news.com\/news\/local\/ar...pproves-budget<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Grand River Hospital has approved a 300 million dollar budget contingent on a two per cent increase in provincial funding.<br \/>    <br \/>    The budget is worth about 10 million dollars more than last year.<br \/>    <br \/>    Items that account for the increase are salaries, excluding executives making more than 150 thousand dollars a year, who will not get a pay hike.<br \/>    <br \/>    Supply and drug costs are also going up, with the cost of cancer medications rising 15 per cent.<br \/>    <br \/>    President Malcolm Maxwell says that if they do not get a two percent increase in government funding, they will be forced to make service reductions.<br \/>    <br \/>    The hospital already announced layoffs for 34 nursing and service staff in November to help eliminate its deficit.","signature":"","date":"03-24-2010 05:49 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"3661":{"user":{"name":"RangersFan","avatar":"\/web\/20100826064640im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Economic Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Jan 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Waterloo    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 559","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u>Grand River Hospital fundraiser going door to door <\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    March 31, 2010 <br \/>    By Johanna Weidner, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    KITCHENER &#8212; Grand River Hospital is sending canvassers to homes in Kitchener and Waterloo to talk about its services to hopefully attract more monthly donors. <br \/>    <br \/>    The goal of the campaign, which started this week and will last a few months, is to sign up 300 new monthly donors to the hospital&#8217;s foundation. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for donations at the door,&#8221; said Jane Jamieson, associate director of the foundation. &#8220;It&#8217;s to provide information about the hospital.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    The hospital ran a smaller scale trial of the fundraising effort last fall to recruit about 150 monthly donors.

The gallery becomes a space where visitors experience the artwork differently depending on their entry point into the gallery. The exhibit is entitled ''Coming and Going.''<br \/>   Two Grade 11 art classes at WCI created two large-scale, deconstructed zoetropes, each 25 images in length. A zoetrope is a device that produces an illusion of action from a rapid succession of static pictures.<br \/>   ''Kitchener and Waterloo have such distinct yet enmeshed identities. Our ambiguous borders and shared streets often make it difficult to tell which city one is in,'' says WCI art teacher, Kyle Bishop. ''At other times, the cities have profoundly different identities and cultures. The overlaps, tensions, and harmonies between the cities act as a core metaphor in this project.''<br \/>   Centred around a sign at the border between Kitchener and Waterloo, the piece is comprised of two sequences: one entering Kitchener (or leaving Waterloo), and one entering Waterloo (or leaving Kitchener). <br \/>   Staged as a moving landscape, students considered the relationship between the cities, and the ways in which their own identities correlate home and place, Bishop says.<br \/>   Personal experiences and histories are filled in both by the students and the viewers.<br \/>   The meet-the-artist reception is scheduled to coordinate with the KYAC awards celebrating the contribution of youth to the community, in the Rotunda on May 6.  <br \/>    <br \/>   <b>Where:<\/b> City of Kitchener Rotunda Gallery, city hall<br \/>   <b>Artist:<\/b> Grade 11 students from Waterloo Collegiate Institute<br \/>   <b>Name of exhibition:<\/b> Coming and Going<br \/>   <b>Artist's reception:<\/b> Thursday, May 6, 5-7 p.m.","signature":"","date":"04-21-2010 05:57 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"5274":{"user":{"name":"panamaniac","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"420"}},"content":"Interesting and timely, given the possible talks on amalgamation.

They show the source of my paintings and are as important to the work as the coloured brushstrokes,&#8221; says Sileika. &#8220;The northern horizon is my subject matter but revealing my artistic process and the uninterrupted gesture of my hand are part of the final presentation.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>Sileika&#8217;s approach to painting is strongly influenced by her initial career as a printmaker. Like state proofs in printmaking, this series includes black-and-white under-paintings, Sileika says. The term describes the monochromatic paintings that reveal the visual framework of her landscapes, allowing the viewer to see a different view of the same landscape -- a highly distilled composition of sky and land.<br \/><br \/>Sileika studied at the University of Toronto and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France. Sileika has had solo exhibitions in Canada, France and Lithuania. In 2003, Michael Glassbourg chose Sileika to be the subject of his documentary, An Artist&#8217;s Life, which aired on Bravo!

Cities already have ways of shutting down unsafe residences. <br \/>   <br \/>   This is nothing more than a tax grab and behind the scenes way to micromanage development. What are the landlords rights if the city refuses to renew a license? Floor, maintenance and parking plans? Are we going to pay some bureaucrat to comb over these plans to make sure they are legit?

For her, the quiet and mature company served her education well.<br \/>    <br \/>    On the other hand, I thought once that it would be a good idea to rent a bachelor apartment in the basement of a co-worker from a co-op placement. Only after signing the year-long lease did he reveal that the shower was broken (took 10 weeks for him to repair it because he wanted to use a friend for cost reasons), the toilet needed replacing (also done by the friend, and for six weeks I had no toilet), the freezer in the fridge was wonky and broke (no freezer for 8 weeks), I would never be given notice of entry into my unit, and eventually the elements listed in the lease came under his attention. He put them there to ensure I wouldn't damage things like the fridge and stove, but admitted he didn't realize it also guaranteed me access to them when I confronted him about trying to sell the appliances out of my unit to pay for the three new vehicles he and his girlfriend had bought.<br \/>    <br \/>    Just as some of the larger group landlords want a bunch of poorly-maintained houses in locations that will always fill with tenants to be their cash cow, some individuals also feel that they can rent out rooms or make basement apartments in their place to supplement their income without having any responsibilities attached. Fair as well, both situations also have their share of responsible landlords, and I've had those too.<br \/>    <br \/>    As much as development controls are needed to avoid the issues of Northdale, the same goes for enforcement of the properties themselves, something that has been poorly done. Just as with traffic: since no one ever seems to get tickets for failing to signal, failing to yield right of way, failing to stop for stop signs or lights, these illegal acts have become daily occurrences, thought of as trivial by those shrugging them off, until the consequences of them, dire as they can be, finally strike home.","signature":"Eventually, you can't go on not caring. <a href=\"\/web\/20110322194758\/http:\/\/viewfromthe42.wordpress.com\/\">You realize you have a voice<\/a>.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sending your LRT thoughts to a local paper or politician?

My taxes pay their salaries, and frankly, I only see incompetence and a total waste of resources when I look at this proposal!<br \/>    <br \/>    This proposal is so beyond reality, that I demand to know how much time &amp; my tax paying money went into this waste of paper!<br \/>    <br \/>    Why is it even being proposed?<br \/>    <br \/>    This is a result of the City of Waterloo, 20 years ago, setting up a license system for Student Lodging Houses so that there was SAFE, AFFORDABLE, housing for students and to lessen any negative impact on the neighbourhoods, these LEGAL LICENCED LODGING HOUSES would be a minimum distance of 75M, later changed to 150m.<br \/>    <br \/>    This CITY RUN system told Investors WHERE &amp; WHAT they could buy as an investment. These investors then paid a PREMIUM for these properties, paid HIGHER TAXES than their unlicensed neighbours, paid for FIRE CODE upgrades, and SAFETY INSPECTIONS \u2013 ALARMS ETC., each year, and the city a LICENSE FEE!!!!!!! <br \/>    <br \/>    Well it failed. It failed because of the cities inability to enforce their own rules. So what now? \u2013 the City is going to tell all these people that after setting a 20 year precedent, that everything that the city had imposed and agreed to is now thrown out the window, and our investments, our retirements, our Children\u2019s Educational funds, mean nothing to them &amp; we can all take a hike! I DO NOT THINK SO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br \/>    <br \/>    Again \u2013 what the HELL are you thinking!!!!!!!!!<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposal comes off with this arrogant attitude that since Oshawa won a few law suites that Waterloo can do what ever they want without fear of losing in Court. <br \/>    <br \/>    Well let me tell you \u2013 don\u2019t change this proposal and we\u2019ll see!!!! <br \/>    <br \/>    Oshawa did NOT set a 20 year precedent with respect to Student Housing \u2013 and they DID allow a number of pre-by-law units to operate outside their new by-law. So when quoting other legal actions, staff once again has come up incompetent. These facts would win our cause in any court since Canadian law is based on precedent. <br \/>    <br \/>    The city also is trying to stage the battle on a \u201csafe housing\u201d platform, which when it comes to LEGAL LICENCED LODGING HOUSES \u2013 any reference that they are unsafe is a blatant LIE!<br \/>    Also, their entire argument that a house with 3 renters is safer than 5 is so ridiculous I am not even going to go into it. <br \/>    Also, if they want to go down that road = then how is it that a wood constructed apartment building on Columbia holding 25 students \u2013 that has the same fire code as a LEGAL LICENSED LODGING HOUSE - be any safer??? Logic would determine that if there were a fire, there is a 5 times greater chance of someone getting hurt \u2013 so once again = WHAT THE HELL !!!!!!<br \/>    <br \/>    The city better start differentiating between LEGAL LICNESED LODGING HOUSING and all the illegally run units out there, especially in the media.<br \/>    <br \/>    I know I personally have NO issue with the city controlling the rash of UNLICENCSED &amp; UNSAFE student housing. The housing that does not comply with the existing LEGAL LICENSED LODING HOUSE rules = that does not comply with the minimum separation rules, to the present safety rules, should be expected to be upheld to the same level and the same requirements of a Legal Licensed Lodging House. There must be an even playing field when it comes to Safety and playing by the rules.<br \/>    <br \/>    But I am SICK of the constant attacks from the city on the very people that have been playing by the rules for over 20 years!!!!!<br \/>    <br \/>    So who wins with this proposal?<br \/>    <br \/>    The Landlords certainly do not win \u2013 too many reasons to list and you will hear them all \u2013 over &amp; over.<br \/>    <br \/>    The small contractor, electrician, Landscaper, - they all stand to lose<br \/>    <br \/>    The Students = if this is imposed -Rents would certainly rise significantly! <br \/>    I have rents ranging from $395\/mnth to 450\/mnth.<br \/>    A city preferred student accommodation such as the new LUX building has rent over $635 \/mnth !!!!!!!<br \/>    I guess WLU &amp; UW are schools for the UTLRA rich \u2013 since the city is driving out any affordable housing. I am sure that is the message that both Universities want <br \/>    \u2013 \u201c Come study here \u2013 we\u2019ll drain you dry \u201c.<br \/>    There is also the whole argument of sharing costs of a unit such as cable, internet, etc.<br \/>    So do any of you have kids planning on going to, or already at University?<br \/>    Where do they live?<br \/>    What do they pay?<br \/>    How about we double that?<br \/>    <br \/>    The City = What does it win???<br \/>    A devalued tax base<br \/>    A multitude of Court cases<br \/>    A system that is so vast that they will not be able to police it anyway. <br \/>    Does the city have an underlining agenda, connected with WLU or a major developer to drive down property values so that they can come in and buy up at a low cost?? Nothing less make sense and this would be criminal!<br \/>    This could be the costliest screw up the City could ever do!<br \/>    <br \/>    Does anyone on staff read a newspaper or watch TV??<br \/>    Can you say \u2013 AMERICAN STYLE HOUSING CRISIS IN WATERLOO<br \/>    Staff is delusional if they think that the devaluation will stop with the Lodging houses. My own personal house is on the Northdale border and I absolutely believe that my value will go down the toilet once the flood gates are opened. <br \/>    <br \/>    There is going to be a great sucking vortex of devaluation on every property within miles of WLU &amp; UW. You are going to have the same American issues \u2013 properties now not worth what is owed. Bank foreclosures. <br \/>    What bank is going to mortgage any property within any distance of such a drastic devaluation?<br \/>    What bank would get involved in a City that would do that to it\u2019s people?<br \/>    Who would ever invest in Waterloo after seeing what City hall does to it\u2019s investors?<br \/>    <br \/>    And you think it is a student ghetto now \u2013 just wait!!! You take away 40+ % of a properties income as well as it\u2019s value and where do you think the money for repairs is going to come from, and add in the fact that no one will or can buy these properties since the bank won\u2019t touch them?<br \/>    <br \/>    Again staff must have really thought this all through!<br \/>    Again WHAT THE HELL !!!!!!<br \/>    I am totally dumb founded by the total lack of judgment by staff.<br \/>    I do call for an inquiry to how such an overall STUPID proposal could even be tabled!<br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO will go down the toilet \u2013 I personally will be (trying) to sell my own home \u2013 which after investing mega dollars in over the years \u2013 I now except to lose on = I thank you for that!<br \/>    But I will not live in a City that is a mini version of Communist North Korea \u2013 Where the government thinks they can walk in &amp; just take what I have been working for all my life! We have rights in this Country and I will fight this till the bitter end. IF THIS REDICULOUS proposal were to ever pass, you can bet one thing,<br \/>    <br \/>    I WILL NOT COMPLY !!!!!!!!!!<br \/>    <br \/>    I hope you are ready for a cat &amp; mouse game with over 1100 units.<br \/>    <br \/>    Also, for example, I have a house with 5 bedrooms \u2013 I sign a lease with 3 people on it \u2013 if by some reason you ever got into that house = which under every privacy law \u2013 ever human right \u2013 you will never set foot in \u2013 and you find 5 people = then what ??? I have a lease for 3 = who are these other 2 people? Friends staying over? Did the students rent the rooms out themselves? How can I as a Landlord control that?? You can try to charge me, but I\u2019ll fight it. I am sure as well as the 1100+ other Landlords will do the same. I guess the purpose of this proposal is to tie the City up in 50 years of court cases. I am sure the people of this city will think that is a great use of their tax paying money! <br \/>    <br \/>    One thing this proposal has already done is unite every Investor to a common front against you the city. You are messing with people\u2019s livelihoods, their retirements, their Educational Funds, and their own personal homes. We are mad as hell! I ask what kind of response did you expect? Again, is staff that na\u00efve? This is about as personal as a subject can get and we will not take it lying down.<br \/>    <br \/>    Bluntly \u2013 either work with us or this will become a NIGHTMARE \u2013 Without our cooperation this will backfire and the city will have even less control. For again I say, as well as I am sure that every INVESTOR in the city says \u2013 <br \/>    <br \/>    WE WILL NOT PUT UP WITH THIS!<br \/>    WE WILL NOT COMPLY! <br \/>    AND PREPARE FOR THE FIGHT OF YOUR LIFE!&quot;","signature":"Benjamin Bach, Director at KW Commercial Realty, Sales Rep. | Read my <a href=\"\/web\/20110322194758\/http:\/\/www.benjaminbach.com\/real-estate-investing-blog\/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate investment blog<\/a><br \/>    Not intended to solicit clients or properties under contract.","date":"01-08-2011 03:13 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"10"},"22358":{"user":{"name":"BuildingScout","avatar":null,"title":"Urban Issues Moderator","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Jul 2010","num_posts":"394"}},"content":"This bylaw is very much in the spirit of the anti-student anti-universities regulations that so dominated city council during the 1990s.

There is a current framework to ensure tenant safety that has existed for a long time, that owners have spent lots of money complying with.  <br \/>   <br \/>   The city is proposing to limit the size of any rental to 3 bedrooms, except for young kids, as well as not permitting any legal non conforming units to continue (&quot;Compliance with Existing By Laws - Owner attests that property meets existing zoning by-laws.&quot;).  <br \/>   <br \/>   This means that an owner of a licensed triplex for 15 - 3 separate units for 5, fully approved by the fire department (lodging houses are inspected regularly for safety issues) in a GRA2 zone - which no longer allows for triplexes, but has many grandfathered in currently - would only be able to rent to 6 (3 in 2 units) and have to evict 7 tenants. <br \/>   <br \/>   For the owner, that means at 65,000 a bed, the property has gone down in value from 975,000 to 390,000.  <br \/>   <br \/>   If an owner has a 65% Loan to Value mortgage on the building (so, a 35% downpayment), they would have a $633,750 mortgage on the property.  <br \/>   <br \/>   If the value is reduced to $390,000, they now owe the bank $240,000 more than the rental property is now worth.  They have to write a cheque for that amount when they sell, and an even bigger cheque to be able to refinance.<br \/>   <br \/>   Plus, now 7 students are out of a house!  They've been kicked out of a $450 a month rental, and have to move into one of the $525 -675 a month rentals dotting King, Columbia and Lester.<br \/>   <br \/>   &lt;sarcasm&gt; Seems like a good deal all around . .  .  &lt;\/sarcasm&gt;","signature":"Benjamin Bach, Director at KW Commercial Realty, Sales Rep. | Read my <a href=\"\/web\/20110322194758\/http:\/\/www.benjaminbach.com\/real-estate-investing-blog\/\" target=\"_blank\">real estate investment blog<\/a><br \/>    Not intended to solicit clients or properties under contract.","date":"01-10-2011 09:15 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"16"},"22392":{"user":{"name":"benjaminbach","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener Waterloo","member_since":"Oct 2010","num_posts":"294"}},"content":"<div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20110322194758im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>Robert<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\/web\/20110322194758\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?p=22388#post22388\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img class=\"inlineimg\" src=\"\/web\/20110322194758im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/buttons\/viewpost-right.png\" alt=\"View Post\" \/><\/a>    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\"> If you are concerned, please let our councillor know what you think, keeping in mind we need something in place to address slum landlords.<\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     No one likes slum landlors, and those aren't the one this will punish.

New events like these are always difficult to get off the ground, so I am incredibly thankful to all of you for showing that there is indeed an appetite for this kind of event, and that a Gallery can be a hot social venue as well as a meditative space. For a first look at the Meet Up, check our Jordan Brennan's post and photos on <a href=\"\/web\/20110208181644\/http:\/\/The transportability of art through fashion\" target=\"_blank\">Free Admission<\/a>.

Let me know if you've created a post or have pics that we can showcase for you!<br \/>    <br \/>    p.s.: The inside scoop on the Meet Up is that it was born of a chance meeting between Justin and I at one of Hilary Abel's famous cinq a sept Thursday nights. It was the first that I had heard of WonderfulWaterloo but knew instantly that they were the perfect partner for a crazy idea I'd been hatching - a tweet up at the Gallery.

Calls to create a single city in this region go back to 1995. Politicians have always rejected them, with strong opposition from Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    The difference this time is that it is a citizen-led group making the call, rather than a panel of politicians or appointed experts.<br \/>    <br \/>    Tuesday afternoon, at a gathering in Cambridge, the group released a 52-page final report titled Finding a Better Way.<br \/>    <br \/>    Citizens for Better Government, which includes some businesspeople, contends the current government system impedes progress for 516,000 residents.<br \/>    <br \/>    The group\u2019s report criticizes the system as confusing to the public, costly for taxpayers and hard for citizens to influence.<br \/>    <br \/>    Residents are governed by three city councils, four township councils, and a regional government. The region provides 70 per cent of services but \u201cremains largely invisible.\u201d This system was established in 1973.<br \/>    <br \/>    Finding a Better Way argues that a single city would:<br \/>    \u2022 Reduce public confusion about who does what and increase political accountability.<br \/>    \u2022 Reduce government costs by $10 million a year through reduced duplication and staffing.<br \/>    \u2022 Provide public services more consistently and efficiently.<br \/>    \u2022 More strongly influence provincial and federal governments.<br \/>    <br \/>    Transition costs to a single city are estimated at $28 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cA single city model,\u201d the report says, \u201cwould have one overall vision, provide efficient and consistent delivery of universally-needed services, have little or no administrative duplication and overlap, reduce costs and ensure clarity of responsibility.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Citizens for Better Government says it has more than 200 members. It is led by a steering committee of 22 who signed the report. They are from all municipalities in the region and include business people and former municipal councillors.<br \/>    <br \/>    The group\u2019s report calls for:<br \/>    \u2022 26 ward councillors plus a mayor, down from 51 municipal politicians today.<br \/>    \u2022 Wards that would span current borders in some places. Rural wards that would be overrepresented compared with urban wards, similar to regional council today.  <br \/>    \u2022 Community councils that would be appointed in former municipalities, to advise city council on local issues such as traffic, street naming, business licences, neighbourhood planning and recreation.<br \/>    <br \/>    If municipal and provincial politicians balk at a single city, the group suggests two other reforms:<br \/>    <br \/>    \u2022 Keeping Waterloo regional government. Merging Kitchener, Waterloo and Woolwich to create a city of 400,000. Wellesley, Wilmot, North Dumfries and Cambridge would remain as today.<br \/>    \u2022 Eliminating regional government and creating two cities: Cambridge, and everybody else. North Dumfries could join either city.<br \/>    <br \/>    The report asks municipal and provincial politicians to consider and respond to the recommendations and \u201chopefully act.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    It does not propose a timeline or a process for this. The next municipal election is in 2010.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:jouthit@therecord.com\">jouthit@therecord.com<\/a> <br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100919073129\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/article\/419294\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"1\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/article\/419294<\/font><\/a>","signature":"","date":"01-08-2010 09:40 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"432":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919073129im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Kitchener calls for amalgamation talks<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    October 06, 2008<br \/>    By Terry Pender<br \/>    RECORD STAFF<br \/>    <br \/>    KITCHENER \u2014 City councillors are calling on their counterparts around the region to begin talks aimed at amalgamating some or all municipalities in Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun.

Part of the push includes an open letter delivered earlier this week to the mayors and councils of Kitchener and Waterloo and signed by more than 50 leaders in business and the arts, including Sandvine president Dave Caputo, Open Text executive chair Tom Jenkins, David Marskell, executive director of the Waterloo Region Children&#8217;s Museum and Jamie Grant, general manager of the Centre in the Square.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I suspect there will be some questions but I also suspect there will be some support,&#8221; Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr said in an interview Thursday.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;How can you say &#8216;no&#8217; to engaging in some dialogue?&#8221; Zehr said.<br \/>   <br \/>   In the 1990s, the Conservative government under then-premier Mike Harris forced amalgamations in Sudbury, Ottawa, Toronto and Hamilton, among other cities. But that government would not force the issue in Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   In 2006, a push for amalgamation came from a group called Citizens for Better Government. That, too, was unsuccessful in advancing the issue among the region, the three cities and the townships.<br \/>   <br \/>   This latest move is focused solely on Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>   <br \/>   Zehr is on board all the way &#8212; holding a referendum, holding talks and creating one city out of two.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;If we cannot have a one-tier system, then at a minimum, Kitchener and Waterloo should look at merging, because it makes eminent sense,&#8221; Zehr said.<br \/>   <br \/>   In Waterloo, Coun. Mark Whaley gets excited about &#8220;extending Waterloo&#8217;s borders to the 401.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   When Whaley was first elected in 2003, the two cities were not co-operating.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Today, we have almost 60 joint service initiatives,&#8221; Whaley said, &#8220;and I have voted for every one of them.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Holding a referendum and then merger talks is a natural evolution, he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;We are talking about a dialogue on merging our cities to provide better services,&#8221; Whaley said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Whaley does not want to see the current push for a municipal merger get bogged down in holding talks with municipalities that are not interested in even talking about it.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Why try to partner with people who do not want to partner with you?&#8221; Whaley said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig has been one of the most vocal opponents of amalgamation into a megacity. Craig and his council were not included in a letter from those pushing for the merger of Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>   <br \/>   The open letter delivered to council members said, in part:<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;How effective is our messaging to regional, provincial and national audiences?

Is our current twin city structure the right plan for ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future?&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Past efforts to address these questions have yielded no conclusive community viewpoint because the discussion has never properly begun. The only way to have this important conversation about our future is to give it the attention it requires, warrants and deserves &#8212; by asking the Province of Ontario to create the environment required for effective dialogue and debate through posing a direct question to the people of both cities during the 2010 municipal election,&#8221; says the letter.","signature":"","date":"01-08-2010 09:48 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"434":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919073129im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"This is good news.

Yes or No.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    The politics around the question are anything but simple.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Waterloo Mayor Brenda Halloran said she will support asking for the referendum, but she has doubts about whether the province will approve one.<br \/>    <\/b><br \/>    \u201cFrom what I understand, and I have heard from various political people, is that there is really no political will at this point in time for the provincial government to engage in any further discussions about amalgamating communities,\u201d Halloran said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Halloran is supported by retired University of Waterloo political science professor Bob Williams, now a consultant specializing in municipal politics, who said, \u201cThis is not a provincial priority.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    There is a bitter legacy from the forced amalgamations of Sudbury, Ottawa, Toronto and Hamilton that occurred under the former Conservative government of then-premier Mike Harris, Williams said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kawartha Lakes was created by forced amalgamation in the late 1990s. The residents there voted in a subsequent referendum to de-amalgamate and the Liberals indicated they would honour that vote, but they reneged on that commitment, Williams said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Simcoe County, created in 1848, has undergone a lot of development, but the Liberal government has refused to get involved in any reforms that would amalgamate the City of Barrie and Simcoe Country in order to better control that development.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThey have shied away from it,\u201d Williams said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional Chair Ken Seiling said the provincial government\u2019s withdrawal from municipal reform has left a lot of people frustrated.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cBecause traditionally, change does not take place unless the province has a hand in it, one way or the other,\u201d Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    So, the city councils of Kitchener and Waterloo must convince the minister of the municipal affairs to inject himself into an area of local politics that has always bristled with challenges.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Provincial legislation specifically forbids municipal governments from holding referendums on municipal restructuring, or even the consideration, investigation, discussion or negotiations about restructuring.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The only way around that is to convince the Municipal Affairs Minister Jim Watson to give permission for a referendum question, Peter-John Sidebottom, a local government adviser at the ministry of municipal affairs, said.<br \/>    <br \/>    If the minister agrees to place the question on the ballots, then it becomes the minister\u2019s question and the results have no force and effect.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt is not binding on the legislature, it is not binding on the minister, it\u2019s not binding on the municipalities,\u201d Sidebottom said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>The taxpayers in Kitchener and Waterloo provide more than 60 per cent of the tax dollars collected by Waterloo Region.<br \/>    <br \/>    But if the two cities merged Waterloo Region could continue, Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt would just mean that one municipality would have a larger number of seats, it would change the voting balance on council,\u201d Seiling said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig disagreed, saying the merger of Kitchener and Waterloo would destroy regional government, which now provides all of the large, expensive services such as police, water and sewage treatment, ambulance and transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt puts into question whether we need a regional government so we need to be prepared down here in Cambridge ahead of time and I am quite prepared to move forward on that and make sure our municipality is not compromised in any merger,\u201d Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIf a merger were to take place in Kitchener-Waterloo, you would at the regional council table have a dominant municipality that controls every vote and would in fact become the real elephant in the room,\u201d Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Craig wants assurances that talks about a merger of Kitchener and Waterloo will not be expanded to other municipalities in the region.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Iain Klugman, president of Communitech, said the group of more than 50 executives who are seeking the referendum, want a complete debate about the issues around merging the cities.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe are at one of those turning points in the history of our community,\u201d Klugman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Tim Jackson, co-founder of Tech Capital Partners; Tom Jenkins, executive chair of Open Text; and Dave Caputo, president of Sandvine are among the high-tech leaders who signed the open letter to the mayors and councillors in Kitchener and Waterloo.

Once small villages, our combined population today approaches 400,000 citizens. As an urban centre we&#8217;re considered one of the fastest-growing and most economically diverse in Canada. We have enjoyed long-term success in advanced manufacturing, insurance, automotive and financial services, while our burgeoning technology sector has achieved international recognition and been identified as a leading economic growth engine. Our universities, college and major research centres are award-winning institutions. We have one of the youngest median populations in Canada, one of the largest new immigrant populations in Canada, and a well supported entrepreneurial culture.<br \/>   <br \/>   Our collective story of hard work, innovation and multiculturalism provides a strong foundation for opportunity. And yet, in having two separately branded cities, uncertainties about our future remain:<br \/>   <br \/>   Have we created the opportunity for confusion, or competition, rather than endorsement, support, camaraderie and growth? Do arbitrary geographic divisions here make sense in an increasingly global economy? Have we truly considered how to best leverage our assets to ensure ongoing quality of life? How effective is our community messaging to regional, provincial and national audiences? Are we maximizing our potential for provincial and national funding, and for investment attraction? Is our current twin city structure the right plan for ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future?<br \/>   <br \/>   Past efforts to address these questions have yielded no conclusive community viewpoint, because the discussion has never properly begun. The only way to have this important conversation about our future is to give it the attention it requires, warrants, and deserves &#8212; by asking the Province of Ontario to create the environment required for effective dialogue and debate through posing a direct question to the people of both Cities during the 2010 municipal election.<br \/>   <br \/>   To that end, we urge the councils of Kitchener and Waterloo to pass a resolution that will set the stage for this important conversation; one that asks the province to place a question on the municipal ballot in the 2010 election that asks:<br \/>   <br \/>   Would you support members of Council engaging in a dialogue about the merits of merging the Cities of Kitchener and Waterloo?&#8221; Yes or No.<br \/>   <br \/>   We&#8217;re asking for your support to have this conversation; so that the people of this community can come together to effectively frame our own future.<br \/>   <br \/>   Respectfully,<br \/>   <br \/>   Dave Caputo, lain Klugman, Mary Bales, Aggie Beynon, Hulene Montgomery, David Strucke, John Whitney, John Baker, Larry Blundell, Cameron Hay, Stephen Basco, Carol Leaman, Dave Bullock, Dennis Watson, Ginny Dybenko, Don Bourgeois, Sunshine Chen, Dennis Grimm, Gerry Remers, Peter Sweeney, Peter Barr, Greg Barratt, Alan Quarry, Mike Milloy, Randy Fowlie, Ray Simonson, Mary D&#8217;Alton, Tim Jackson, Jamie Martin, Tom Jenkins,Brian Doody, Steve Bryant, Jan Varner, Brad Marsland, Howard Armitage, David Kruis, Marc Morin, Savvas Chamberlain, Yvan Couture, Rick Stroobosscher, Joan Fisk, Roger Farwell, Bruce Gordon, Eugene Moser, Steve Farlow, Jamie Grant, Murray Gamble, Jacqui Murphy, Mark Bingeman, Andrew Bass, David Fedy, Tom Beynon, Andrew Abouchar, Rosemary Smith, Ken Coates, Len Ruby, David Petras, Neil Aitchison, David Marskell, Rod Foster, Phil Deck, Joseph Fung, Ted Hastings, Jane Jantzi, Jim Stirtzinger, Frank Boutzis.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> <a href=\"\/web\/20100919073129\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/Opinions\/Editorials\/article\/653419\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"1\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/Opinions\/Editorials\/article\/653419<\/font><\/a>","signature":"","date":"01-11-2010 09:36 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"10"},"577":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919073129im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"A good editorial from Saturday:<br \/>   <br \/>   <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">A timely call for merger talks<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   January 09, 2010<br \/>   <br \/>   An old word has roared back into Waterloo Region for a new decade and with lots of new twists. The word is amalgamation. But before you groan that we&#8217;ve been there and tried that too many times with too much aggravation, look what&#8217;s on the table and who put it there.<br \/>   <br \/>   Instead of trying to roll the region&#8217;s eight governments into one &#8212; which has been unsuccessfully tried &#8212; today&#8217;s advocates of change are putting their energies into merging just Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s a new generation and a new group of community leaders, in large part from our high-tech sector, in the driver&#8217;s seat this time. One of the generals leading the charge is Tim Jackson, a founder of Tech Capital Partners and vice-chair of the University of Waterloo Research + Technology Park Accelerator Centre. Instead of building their case on saving tax dollars, Jackson and his colleagues are arguing that one larger, merged city will have a bigger voice and make a greater splash in the globalized economy than two smaller communities frantically competing against each other.<br \/>   <br \/>   It&#8217;s too soon to know what this plan would mean and if it&#8217;s the right fit for the people of Kitchener and Waterloo, as well as their fellow citizens of Waterloo Region. It&#8217;s not too soon to applaud the 52-people who have signed a letter calling for a referendum this fall to empower the two cities to hold merger talks. Nor is it premature to say that the municipal ballots in Kitchener and Waterloo in this October&#8217;s municipal elections should include the following question.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Would you support the members of council engaging in a dialogue about the merits of merging the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo? Yes or No?&#8217;&#8217;<br \/>   <br \/>   This referendum, with these words, should proceed. The councils of Kitchener and Waterloo should endorse the referendum. The government of Ontario, which has the final say, should approve it. Then, let democracy rule and the voters of these two cities decide. While the provincial Liberals have not encouraged municipal amalgamations since taking power six years ago, they have consistently affirmed that they will listen and respond to local requests for change. So for now, the Liberals should listen, and help the people of Kitchener and Waterloo plan their future.<br \/>   <br \/>   For more than 150 years these two communities have been hamlets, villages, towns and cities living side-by-side and gradually growing into each other to the extent that you need a sign or a map to tell you when you&#8217;ve left Waterloo and entered Kitchener. People across Canada refer to Kitchener-Waterloo even though, officially speaking, such a hyphenated entity doesn&#8217;t exist.<br \/>   <br \/>   Many people live in one of the cities but work in the other; Waterloo citizens use Kitchener&#8217;s libraries, catch a concert at Kitchener&#8217;s Centre in the Square or cheer the Rangers at the Kitchener Aud. Citizens of Kitchener play at Waterloo&#8217;s RIM Park, take a course at one of Waterloo&#8217;s universities or shop in Waterloo&#8217;s downtown. In many day-to-day practical ways, the two cities already act like one.<br \/>   <br \/>   On its own, a merged Kitchener-Waterloo wouldn&#8217;t become Utopia. A merged city would still be the lower tier in a regional municipality where the regional government still spends most of the money and would deliver many of the most important services, such as policing, public transit, water and sewage treatment and social services. Moreover, a merged Kitchener-Waterloo could upset the delicate balance between the northern and southern parts of the region and leave a disgruntled Cambridge feeling alienated.<br \/>   <br \/>   The proponents of amalgamation contend that a city of nearly 400,000 people would command more attention in Canada and around the world than two smaller cities both vying for government grants and corporate investments. As a single city, with a diverse and rapidly growing population as well as a diversified economy with a surging high-tech sector, a merged Kitchener-Waterloo could aspire to become a respected and recognized player in the global economy.<br \/>   <br \/>   Other benefits of a merger are easy to see. Several years ago, Kitchener and Waterloo briefly explored co-operating with their library services and teaming up to build a grand, main library branch to serve both communities in this information age. The idea went nowhere; each city pursued more modest improvements to their libraries. And each threw away the opportunity to better serve its citizens in this information age. There is a strong argument that a united Kitchener and Waterloo could provide stronger support to the arts community and deliver to the public stronger cultural and recreational services.<br \/>   <br \/>   But perhaps we run ahead of ourselves. It is a new year, a new decade. It is the right time to look at the world and our little part of it in new ways. Hurray for the people calling for the Twin Cities to become the one city.

Taxes were increased and some services reduced. The efficiencies and savings touted by the former Ontario government of then-premier Mike Harris never materialized.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>But Sancton notes there are big differences here.<br \/>   <br \/>   Firstly and most importantly, the merger would be voluntary and based on a referendum held in both cities during the Oct. 25 municipal elections.<br \/>   <br \/>   Secondly, Sancton said you have to compare the level of services provided in both cities, the wages for municipal employees in both cities and the salaries of administrators. If all of those are roughly equal then a merger could be effected that does not result in large tax increases for some property owners.<\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;The key thing is they are both urban areas, you are not trying to put together urban and rural and widely disparate communities,&#8221; Sancton said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;Of all the proposals I have heard about in recent years this one potentially makes the most sense,&#8221; Sancton said. &#8220;I am not saying it is bound to succeed or anything, but there is a certain logic to it.

The minister must place the question on the ballot because municipal mergers are the sole jurisdiction of the provincial government.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit hard for me to understand why anybody would be opposed to having a vote or referendum on the question,&#8221; Sancton said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Sancton stresses his opposition in the past has been to amalgamations forced on cities by provincial governments, some of which brought together urban areas with small towns and rural townships with varying levels of services and taxation.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there are examples of forced, legislated mergers that lead to any significant savings and certainly most of them lead to excess costs, new costs and problems and splits between urban and rural areas,&#8221; Sancton said.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I would think a merger between Kitchener and Waterloo would have fewer of the pitfalls than other places have experienced,&#8221; Sancton said.<br \/>   <br \/>   About 15 years ago there was a referendum held in two cities in British Columbia&#8212;Abbotsford and Matsqui. The voters in both jurisdictions voted in favour of amalgamation. They also voted in the same referendum to call the united city Abbotsford, which is 80 kilometres east of Vancouver on the Fraser River.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I think it has been a marvelous success,&#8221; Abbotsford Mayor George Peary said. &#8220;We are now a vibrant city of 135,000. We are British Columbia&#8217;s fifth largest city.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Abbotsford was about one quarter the size of its sister city prior to amalgamation. Taxes there went up by 25 per cent over five years following amalgamation, but the residents got access to a modern water system.<br \/>   <br \/>   Prior to amalgamation both cities shared a fire, library and recreation services. But each had its own council, mayor and local administration.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;My sense is very few people would revert back to the former way,&#8221; Peary said. &#8220;We are stronger and better because of the courageous steps taken by the taxpayers and the few politicians who were prepared to say, &#8216;We can work better as one.&#8217; &#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"mailto:tpender@therecord.com\">tpender@therecord.com<\/a><br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20100919073129\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/656855\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"1\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/656855<\/font><\/a>","signature":"","date":"01-17-2010 08:58 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"17"},"755":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919073129im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Anti-merger advocate sees \u2018a certain logic\u2019 to marriage of Kitchener, Waterloo<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    January 16, 2010<br \/>    By Jeff Outhit, Record staff<br \/>    <br \/>    WATERLOO REGION \u2014 Politicians expressed delight and dismay after a leading antimerger expert said it may make sense to merge Kitchener and Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>    Political scientist Andrew Sancton sees a \u201ccertain logic\u201d to a voluntary local merger. \u201cI don\u2019t quite understand what has kept Kitchener and Waterloo apart for so long,\u201d said Sancton, a University of Western Ontario professor.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sancton has long criticized forced municipal mergers as costly failures, and he\u2019s uncertain whether a local merger will succeed. But he struggles to understand why anybody would oppose a proposed October referendum, asking the public to endorse merger talks.<br \/>    <br \/>    The referendum has been endorsed by Kitchener council and is under review by Waterloo council. Here\u2019s how key players reacted:<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr, who favours a merger: \u201cIn an ironic way, Mr. Sancton has perhaps helped the discussion, because people will say, \u2018Well, maybe it is right, maybe some people are right that this is one of the most logical ones to occur.\u2019 . . . It encourages me.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Waterloo Mayor Brenda Halloran, who favours a referendum: \u201cI think that\u2019s a really positive sign. I think that it shows that people should be willing to revisit issues. I think people should be really encouraged to be open-minded, to really think it through.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig, who opposes a merger: \u201cI think the interpretation is very clear. Mergers are bad, but if you have to go any particular route, this particular situation would be the least of all the evils. I don\u2019t personally see any logic in it.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Entrepreneur Tim Jackson, speaking for business leaders who propose a referendum: \u201cYou\u2019ve got people on both sides of the issue saying this is something worth having a conversation about. When someone like that comes out and says, \u2018There may be some merit one way or the other,\u2019 it\u2019s definitely time for his conversation to happen.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Waterloo Coun. Karen Scian, who opposes a referendum: \u201cHe\u2019s talking about a completely hypothetical situation because we\u2019re not allowed to merge as cities, without the province doing it. There\u2019s no concept of voluntary merger involved in these conversations. So what he\u2019s saying really I don\u2019t think applies to our situation.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Waterloo Coun. Jan d\u2019Ailly, who\u2019s undecided on a referendum: \u201cI think it\u2019s another piece of information. Certainly, if you have two very, very like cities and they\u2019re on their own, you could certainly see where he comes from. However, I think we have to look at it in terms of the context of Waterloo Region as a whole.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>     \u2022 Waterloo Coun. Mark Whaley, who favours a referendum: \u201cHe says himself, first of all, this is a time for the citizens to be asked. This is one of the few cases where the citizens are actually being asked. And I think that\u2019s really positive. And might lead to a conclusion that has buy-in by the residents going in.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:jouthit@therecord.com\">jouthit@therecord.com<\/a><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100919073129\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/657482\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"1\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/657482<\/font><\/a>","signature":"","date":"01-17-2010 09:00 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"18"},"864":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919073129im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Opposition already forming to amalgamation push<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   By Greg MacDonald, Chronicle Staff<br \/>   Jan 20, 2010<br \/>   <br \/>   No matter what the city decides next week when weighing whether or not to hold a referendum on amalgamation, the debate is already raging in the community.<br \/>   <br \/>   No one&#8217;s more aware of that than Coun. Karen Scian, who has been polling her constituents for their views on joining with Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener already plans to ask the province to put a question on the ballot in the spring and Waterloo council will decide Monday whether to endorse that process.<br \/>   <br \/>   The results of Scian&#8217;s poll have been mixed to say the least. She sent out an e-mail to 150 people asking for their views, and figures she&#8217;s heard every opinion in the spectrum.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s given me a lot to think about,&#8221; Scian said. &#8220;It&#8217;s illuminating how divergent opinions are on this.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Scian has been posting responses on her blog at kscian.wordpress.com .<br \/>   <br \/>   They range from the adamant &#8212; &#8220;My answer is emphatically &#8212; YES!&#8221; to &#8220;NO for me,&#8221; to anywhere in between.<br \/>   <br \/>   Some highlights:<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8226; &#8220;I am not opposed to having the question asked. I think Waterloo will vote overwhelmingly no and then we can put this to rest.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8226; &#8220;I do not believe in the near future that Waterlooians will say Yes to amalgamation while Kitchener will always want amalgamation.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8226; &#8220;I have been following this and am of the opinion it needs to be studied.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8226; &#8220;I am wondering who the &#8216;Community leaders&#8217; are? I know the business people behind the idea are only interested in business ventures getting more of a profile instead of the well-being of Waterloo. What is in it for Waterloo?&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8226; &#8220;All else being equal (e. g. I don&#8217;t feel I know what pros and cons would a merger bring), I feel normally bigger is better in terms of capacity to deliver services and efficiency to do it. For this overall reason, I feel looking more into a merger is a good idea and to not consider it further would be crazy.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   For the rest, see Scian&#8217;s blog.<br \/>   <br \/>   Scian has received just under 40 responses<br \/>   <br \/>   and she&#8217;s hoping to get more before Monday&#8217;s decision.<br \/>   <br \/>   But the responses so far have already cleared up one of Scian&#8217;s concern, which was the lack of an organized opposition.<br \/>   <br \/>   The amalgamation debate was brought back into the forefront by a group of businesspeople fronted by high-tech leader Tim Jackson.<br \/>   <br \/>   Scian expressed concern that special interest groups would dominate any debate.<br \/>   <br \/>   But the emergence of the website onewaterloo.ca has proven there will be at least two sides if an amalgamation question is asked.<br \/>   <br \/>   The site was launched Sunday as an alternative, grassroots voice for the issue. It is clearly opposed to amalgamation and beseeches visitors to &#8220;Keep Waterloo Independent.&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   The people behind the site declined an interview with the Chronicle.<br \/>   <br \/>   But for Scian, their presence is reassuring.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I&#8217;m starting to see the benefit of putting a question on the ballot,&#8221; she said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Councillors will debate asking the amalgamation question during Monday&#8217;s council meeting, 6:30 p. m. in council chambers.

Yes or No?\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener city council has already voted in favour of the move. Waterloo city council asked for a report from staff.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>That report, which was delivered to Waterloo city councillors yesterday, says a referendum would cost very little, perhaps less than $5,000, would not be binding on anyone, that only the provincial government can place the question on the ballot because municipal restructuring is its jurisdiction and that a question from the Minister of Municipal Affairs must be given to the city clerk by June 1.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Whaley, who has supported the call for a referendum, said he will listen carefully to the delegations at Monday\u2019s meeting.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI know where I stand today,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cI could be convinced otherwise by the presentation Monday night, I am not going into it close-minded.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Whaley added: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have the entire community have their say on the issue by putting the question on the ballot?\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun.

Yes or No?\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener council has already voted in favour of the move.<br \/>    <br \/>    Two weeks ago, Waterloo asked for more time to consider the issue. Last night, Mayor Brenda Halloran and councillors Mark Whaley and Ian McLean voted for the motion. Voting against were councillors Scott Witmer, Jan d\u2019Ailly, Karen Scian, Angela Vieth, and Diane Freeman. <br \/>    <br \/>    Freeman said the issue had been considered and rejected several times in the past, and only served to divide the community.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe say things about each other that are hurtful and that are destructive,\u201d she said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Halloran, on the other hand, said it was necessary for the citizens of Waterloo to have their say. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cHow do we move forward if we don\u2019t allow people to have a voice?\u201d she asked. <br \/>    <br \/>    Prior to the vote, council heard from several members of the public.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThere is no groundswell of support from either the citizens of Kitchener or Waterloo,\u201d argued Stan Rektor.<br \/>    <br \/>    Several people voiced their concerns about differences between the two cities, especially when it comes to conflicting approaches to environmental preservation and urban development.<br \/>    <br \/>    Rosemary Smith, executive director of the Kitchener and Waterloo Community Foundation, and a member of the group advocating for merger talks, had urged council to pass the motion.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI believe it is a discussion we must enter into in earnest,\u201d she said. \u201cHelp us set the stage for an important conversation about our future.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    After the vote, Smith expressed her disappointment with the results, but said there was still work to be done.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThe citizens of Waterloo have not yet spoken, and until they do, I think it\u2019s still alive.\u201d","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20100919133748\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/Fluoridation\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"blue\">Fluoridation Forum #2 | Thursday October 7, 2010 7:00PM - 8:30PM @ Waterloo Memorial Recreation Complex<\/font><\/b><\/a>","date":"01-26-2010 02:14 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"29"},"1161":{"user":{"name":"Spokes","avatar":"\/web\/20100919133748im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?s=5cad6e6a15e964c61669743b5cc3cbed&amp;u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Date Dec 2009    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation Kitchener    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 3,497","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"That's a real shame.

The province must put the question on the ballot because municipal restructuring is the sole preserve of Queen\u2019s Park.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThis was such a tremendous opportunity for the citizens of Kitchener and Waterloo to have the opportunity to have their say on whether they wanted to dialogue on this issue, whether this issue is important,\u201d Klugman said Tuesday.<br \/>    <br \/>    The coalition of business and community leaders intends to regroup and develop a new strategy that keeps the issue alive.<br \/>    <br \/>    When asked if the group would organize a public education campaign or perhaps run pro-amalgamation candidates in this fall\u2019s municipal elections, Klugman would only say, \u201cAll options are on the table.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThat\u2019s what we are in the process of discussing \u2014 where do we go from here?\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Since the letter by the pro-talks group was made public earlier this month, Klugman said the group has received widespread encouragement from people in both cities.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cMore than ever people want to have a say,\u201d Klugman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    After Waterloo city council nixed the idea of a referendum, the group received dozens of emails and calls of support expressing disappointment and frustration, Klugman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe absolutely have to continue on,\u201d Klugman said. \u201cWe are considering all the options right now. We are going to have to a plan put together very shortly.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Their proposed question for the referendum was: \u201cWould you support members of council engaging in a dialogue about the merits of merging Kitchener and Waterloo? Yes or No.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Several delegations appeared at Waterloo city council on Monday speaking against a referendum on merger talks. Kitchener Mayor Carl Zehr said Waterloo council allowed itself to be persuaded by a handful of anti-referendum delegations that pale in comparison to the more than 60 community and business leaders in favour of merger talks.<br \/>    <br \/>    And, some of the comments irked Zehr.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI was stunned by the result,\u201d Zehr said. \u201cI was very disappointed and shocked by some of the negative attacks that were made on individuals and Kitchener specifically.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposed referendum only asked about holding merger talks, not about whether the cities should be amalgamated \u2014 a key point that was lost in the debate, Zehr said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:tpender@therecord.com\">tpender@therecord.com<\/a> <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100919133748\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/662942\" target=\"_blank\"><font size=\"1\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/662942<\/font><\/a>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> I think Zehr's last comment is dead on.

There were about 16 delegations who spoke to many aspects of the issue.<br \/>   <br \/>   In voting no, I made an alternative recommendation to establish a task force which will address the issues raised and start the dialogue that is needed.<br \/>   <br \/>   A summary of my comments at Council are below. Please feel to contact me if you would like to discuss further.<br \/>   <br \/>   When any 50 residents come and make a proposal to Council, it is Council&#8217;s job to evaluate the merits of the request, have an opportunity to have a discussion on the topic, and not to jump to conclusions. For the Record to suggest that this Council is not being responsible because it did make decision on a merger referendum question the same day the formal request was made for a merger proposal that is just 2 weeks old, shows just how divisive this debate can be.<br \/>   <br \/>   There are many people who oppose a merger, and see discussion of the merits of a merger as the thin edge of the wedge to start down that path to somewhere they do not want to go.<br \/>   <br \/>   Equally, there are many who support a merger and see a discussion on the merits of a merger as the thin edge of the wedge to start down that path they want to go.<br \/>   <br \/>   Collectively, we have to step back, take a collective deep breath, listen to each other, and figure out a way to move forward to deal with these issues in a constructive manner.<br \/>   <br \/>   This is what I have heard tonight and over the past few weeks and years<br \/>   <br \/>   The business community feels that we can be greater than we already are. There are issues with branding and other things that don&#8217;t work well.<br \/>   <br \/>   There are challenges with getting funding for the arts and sorting out funding priorities between the different municipalities.<br \/>   <br \/>   A process for discussion is needed that leads to a conclusion<br \/>   <br \/>   Participation in the Citizens for Better Government process overall was quite low.<br \/>   <br \/>   There are many differences between Kitchener and Waterloo, and many shared services<br \/>   <br \/>   What we need to do is undertake a process to have the discussion without any preconceived outcome. We need a process that is seen to be open and transparent, and without preconceived outcomes, and where everyone can feel free to discuss the issues without agendas. It is unrealistic to have that happen discussing the merits of a merger.<br \/>   <br \/>   Therefore, instead of a referendum, I recommend that we set up a (region wide) task force with a mandate to:<br \/>   1) Identify the pros and cons of the current governance model<br \/>   2) What are the problem area<br \/>   3) What are the choices and options<br \/>   <br \/>   I undertook that I would put together a more formal description of the task force I the next couple of weeks and present it to Council. I am committed to ensure that this process will get to a conclusion.<br \/>   <br \/>   With the process, we will be able to have a discussion about what the issues are, so that everyone can understand what the issues are, and balance them off against what works and what does not work. This can be a true community dialogue where understanding can develop, and solutions found.<br \/>   <br \/>   It is on this basis that I did not support the motion presented.<br \/>   <br \/>   I would me more than happy to discuss this process with you, and any further ideas on moving forward.<br \/>   <br \/>   Jan     \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div> Might be worth taking him up on his offer and have a meeting with him and\/or the media (like the Barrel Yards Roundtable last year).

Yes or No.\u201d Kitchener council had already supported the motion.<br \/>    <br \/>    It was a difficult and emotional decision for Waterloo councillors, who have struggled with the question ever since it came up two weeks ago. That wasn\u2019t more apparent than when Coun. Scott Witmer seemingly changed his mind in the middle of a comment.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI know where I stand. I know where people in this room stand. But I don\u2019t know where the rest of the people stand.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWhen I started this comment two minutes ago I still didn\u2019t where I stood. But this question is misleading . . . I can\u2019t support it.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Witmer defeated the motion, along with Coun. Angela Vieth, Coun. Karen Scian, Coun. Jan d\u2019Ailly and Coun. Karen Scian.<br \/>    <br \/>    Scian too had struggled with the question, but believed that the special interest group pushing the question was looking to make things easier for themselves. Her decision was cemented when Joseph Fung, a delegation to council, said even if the debate died now, it would be back \u2014 even if people voted no in October.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWhy would it come back?\u201d Scian asked.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWell if I asked you if you wanted an iPhone now, you might say no. But you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ll say in the future,\u201d Fung said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI think my city is more important than an iPhone,\u201d said a clearly irritated Scian.<br \/>    <br \/>    Councillors on both sides of the issue spoke passionately about it. But the debate can be harmful, Freeman said. \u201cWhenever amalgamation is discussed, a division cuts the community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe say things about each other that are hurtful and destructive.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Others believed a referendum was not the way to go.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Jan d\u2019Ailly believes there is merit in exploring joint servicing or improved services. In the coming weeks, he\u2019ll propose a task force made up from representatives from both Kitchener and Waterloo to explore the issues surrounding amalgamation.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThere will be no presupposed conclusion, just a discussion,\u201d d\u2019Ailly said.<br \/>    <br \/>    But Coun. Ian McLean believes that discussion must go to the public.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cOur community is strong and mature enough to engage in discussions about our future,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Mayor Brenda Halloran also wanted to see the issue go to a vote.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that question,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to hear from the citizens here who pay the bills. \u201cI am strongly convinced the right thing for myself as mayor is to let this community have a say in its future.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    The motion fell, however, and the amalgamation debate will likely recede.<br \/>    <br \/>    Iain Klugman, the president of Communitech and a member of the pro-amalgamation group, wouldn\u2019t say what\u2019s next.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI think the citizens of Waterloo have missed out on an opportunity to have their voices heard,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20100919133748\/http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/200883\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/200883<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><u><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"Blue\">Public come out to have their say on amalgamation<\/font><\/font><\/u><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Jan 27, 2010<br \/>    <br \/>    The people of Waterloo \u2013 and a few from Kitchener \u2014 came out to have their voices heard on the amalgamation issue Monday night.<br \/>    <br \/>    There was a range of views, but the majority were against a referendum.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThe system is set up for you to tackle the big questions, not punt them back to us if they\u2019re too tough,\u201d said Waterloo resident Jeff Henry.<br \/>    <br \/>    He believes a discussion needs to take place, but among politicians, not at the polling booths.<br \/>    <br \/>    Others wished calls for amalgamation would just go ahead and die already.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cKitchener is a brain tumor.

Looking at a wide range of indicators on the presence, growth, health and policy environment for small business ownership and entrepreneurship, Western Canadian cities dominate the list for 2010. Alberta metropolitan areas occupy five of the top 10, including top ranking Grande Prairie. Lloydminster, on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border is close behind, followed by two more Saskatchewan communities, Saskatoon and Prince Albert.<br \/>   <br \/>   Scores are slightly higher than last year, mainly because the economy is further in recovery. However, only two out of 100 cities in the list score higher than 70 out of 100-which shows there is room for considerable improvement even for cities near the top of the list. Typically small and mid-size cities outpoint larger urban cores.<br \/>   <br \/>   What makes an entrepreneurial city:<br \/>   <br \/>   There is no question that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are Canada's engine of growth. After all, SMEs employ about 53% of all working individuals in the country. Businesses, whether they are located in urban or rural areas, play an integral part in the economic and social well-being of communities. In this study, Canadians can gain a better understanding of the triumphs and hardships of small business ventures.<br \/>   <br \/>   There is no single best way to measure the entrepreneurship quotient of cities, so CFIB combines a range of approaches to arrive at an overall score. It may seem obvious, but the surest signs of an entrepreneurial hot spot are the presence of a high concentration of entrepreneurs and a high business start-up rate. It is also important that business owners have high levels of optimism and success in their operations. Good public policy is also critical, so we look at the presence of supportive local government tax and regulatory policies.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     Follow this link for the full report, surprisingly Waterloo isn't at the top of this list, or anywahere on this list for that matter???

Not in the slightest.<br \/>    <br \/>    If we want to talk about city-building, I wouldn't rank Waterloo Region that high at all.  Sure, we have some visioning coming out of the Region and the City of Kitchener, but the few good things we have planned meet tremendous opposition from a lot of visionless, small town stalwarts in this city.  In this respect, I would say places like Calgary have far more of an optimism in terms of their view of growth.  Historically, they've also made bold moves like the LRT when they were around our population.<br \/>    <br \/>    Does anyone really think there's something running through the blood of locals that makes us smarter, more innovative, and more entrepreneurial?  Seems silly to me.<br \/>    <br \/>    2) Organizations like Communitech, as positive as they are, bring a certain bias to their assessment of the state of affairs in this Region.  They're going to be understandly more optimistic and 'community-aware' than the general public.  I see them as a benefit to the region, but I don't think they represent 545,000 people that well.<br \/>    <br \/>    3) Wood Buffalo and these other resource-based economies among the most innovative??  That's a laugh.  Their weath is basically inherited from mother earth, with very little value added to the wealth they extract out of the ground, whether it's oil in Wood Buffalo or potash just outside of Saskatoon.  A lot of these places don't have a back-up plan if their one-trick pony were to falter.  Although, in the sense that people move to these places and set up businesses (benefitting from resource-based spin-offs) to 'ride the wave of wealth', they may be more entrepreneurial than Waterloo Region.","signature":"","date":"01-26-2011 05:53 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"23810":{"user":{"name":"mpd618","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"998"}},"content":"One way of thinking about this, at least in the retail sphere, is how many independent establishments we have, as compared with chains.

The estimated cost ranges from $9.7 million to $11.3 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cory Bluhm, the city's urban investment adviser, said the tenders will be designed so that less expensive materials can be used to keep the costs within the maximum budget of $8.8 million.<br \/>    <br \/>    &quot;One of the items would be the amount of specialized surface treatments, like granite, reducing the amount we would require or looking at similar materials that may be a little more cost effective,&quot; Bluhm said.<br \/>    <br \/>    New planters that allow rainwater to soak into the ground, new transit shelters and new bike racks will be installed. The area in front of City Hall will be better designed for major festivals, with accent lighting, caf?s, very low curbs and new trees.<br \/>    <br \/>    The project is proceeding with few changes to the original plans, Bluhm said. &quot;There are no major items we are removing, it's more scaling back in smaller detailed areas that would not impact the overall objective.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>    Construction schedules will not be set until the city consults with businesses along King Street.

New planters, improved and modern-looking street lights and wider sidewalks are the signatures of the newly reinvented downtown.<br \/>    <br \/>    The idea behind the Speakers Corner renovation was to open up a more viable space for the community, said Bluhm.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe wanted to make sure it is conducive to public events,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted to give it a new civic function and still keep with the notion of what Speaker\u2019s Corner was.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>That notion is summed up in the new focal points of the square \u2014 the three part installation that blends the corner\u2019s soapbox heritage with its new, sleek facelift.<br \/>    <br \/>    The work, titled Relocation and Transformation of Memory, is made up of three separate pieces in the square, including the centre sculpture. The piece features and anamorphic image \u2013 one that appears distorted unless viewed from a specific perspective.<br \/>    <br \/>    When a viewer stands on the tiles at the base of the work and looks into the mirrored piece, they can see a photograph of the old square reflected back from a skewed image printed on the tiles.<br \/>    <\/b><br \/>    Physics professor Jim Hunt of Guelph worked with MacKay to develop the anamorphic aspect of the piece.<br \/>    <br \/>    Two granite-clad walls etched with the phrases, \u201cSPEAK UP SPEAK OUT\u201d and \u201cSPEAKINGPUBLICSPEAKING\u201d also border the square. The total cost for the art was $80,000.<br \/>    <br \/>    The granite etchings mirror some of MacKay\u2019s other high profile work, including the Veterans Memorial at the provincial legislature and the Pape subway modernization in Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>The same granite used for the pieces at Speaker\u2019s Corner will soon cover the new planters lining the entire stretch of King Street.<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The piece drew a flock of curious onlookers Friday. Most stared for a few moments before cracking a smile when they discovered the reflection of the ghost of the old Speaker\u2019s Corner.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d said Ashley Hamilton, who pulled over to check out what was happening in the square after she saw the crowd gathered. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great idea. It\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Work on the next phase of project has already started on the two streets bordering city hall.

They'll likely want to do something a little more thematically appropriate through the Warehouse District, something with an old-fashioned feel. That being said, I'm not certain that's a good idea on King St. The only old building on King St in the Warehouse District in the Kaufman lofts, and there's the UW pharmacy campus which is definitely modern. I think in an ideal world the streetscaping could go as far as William St. Beyond that it doesn't fit with the design of Uptown. More realistically though, I want to see it extended through the Market District. Though not right away, the new streetscape is bringing new life to downtown Kitchener, let's not kill it with permanent construction.","signature":"Taylor Byrnes","date":"05-22-2010 01:33 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"43"},"7379":{"user":{"name":"Waterlooer","avatar":"\/web\/20100527135122im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=284&amp;dateline=1271634757","title":"Member","extra_info":{"from":"Date Apr 2010    \t\t\t\t\t\tLocation K\/W    \t\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t\tPosts 58","member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"They need to reconstruct the market district...

The homeland is undergoing critical events and difficult tests, which have started with honest young people and citizens. They have the right for peaceful demonstrations to express their worries, but they were exploited very quickly by those who wanted to manipulate the situation to create chaos and destroy the constitution.<br \/>   <br \/>   These demonstrations moved from a civilized expression of practicing freedom of speech to sad confrontations which were organized by political groups who wanted to throw fire on the oil and to threaten the stability, and provoke, and create looting and destruction and fires, and to block roads, and to attack national possessions and public and private possessions, and attacks on some diplomatic missions on Egypt.<br \/>   <br \/>   We are living together in difficult days, and what hurts our hearts the most and the fear which has overtaken most Egyptians and the anxiety which has overtaken them regarding what tomorrow will bring for them and their families and the future and destiny of their country. <br \/>   <br \/>   The events of the last few days impose on us all, as people and as a leadership, choosing between chaos and stability and brings in front of us new circumstances and a different Egyptian reality, which our people and our army must deal with in the most wise ways in order to protect Egypt's interests and its children.<br \/>   <br \/>   My brother and sisters, citizens, I have initiated the formation of a new government with new priorities and initiatives which will respond to our young people's demands and their anxieties. And in dialogue with all political forces, we have discussed all the issues that have been raised regarding democratic and political reforms and constitutional changes  -- which will be required in order to fulfill these legitimate demands and the restoration of stability and security.<br \/>   <br \/>   But there are political forces who have rejected this invitation for dialogue, holding on to their private agendas, and without concern for Egypt's situation, and with their rejection for my invitation to dialogue -- which still stands.<br \/>   <br \/>   I will directly speak to my people, from its peasants, workers, Muslims, and cooks, its old people and its young people, and to all Egyptian men and women in the countryside and in the cities across the land, and in all the districts. I never wanted power or prestige, and people know the difficult circumstances in which I shouldered the responsibility and what I have given to the homeland during war and during the peace.<br \/>   <br \/>   I am also a man of the army, and it is not in my nature to give up responsibility. My first responsibility now is to restore the security and stability of the homeland, to achieve a peaceful transition of power in an environment that will protect Egypt and Egyptians, and which will allow for responsibility to be given to whoever the people will elect in the forthcoming elections.<br \/>   <br \/>   I will say with all honesty -- and without looking at this particular situation -- that I was not intent on standing for the next elections, because I have spent enough time in serving Egypt, and I am now careful to conclude my work for Egypt by presenting Egypt to the next government in a constitutional way which will protect Egypt.<br \/>   <br \/>   I want to say in clear terms that, in the next few months that are remaining of my current term, I will work very hard to carry out all the necessary measures to transfer power to the authorized legitimate.<br \/>   <br \/>   The constitutional articles 67 and 77  should be changed to allow very specific periods for presidency, and in order for the parliament to be able to discuss these constitutional changes and the legislative changes which -- of the laws linked to the constitution, and in order to guarantee that all political powers will contribute to these discussions, I ask of the parliament to commit to speed up the elections.<br \/>   <br \/>   I will pursue the transfer of power in a way that will fulfill the people's demands and that this new government will fulfill the people's demands and their hopes for political, economic and social progress, and for the provision of employment opportunities and fighting poverty and achieving social justice.<br \/>   <br \/>   And in this context, I want to ask the police to carry out their role in protecting the citizens honestly and to respect their rights and freedoms and their dignity.<br \/>   <br \/>   I also want to ask censorship authorities and legislative authorities to carry out immediately every measure to pursue those who are corrupt and those who have been responsible for what has happened of all the destructive acts and looting and fires that have taken place in Egypt. This is my promise for the people during the next few months that remain of my current leadership. I ask of God that he will help me to do my job in a way that will be satisfactory to God and to my homeland and its people.<br \/>   <br \/>   Egypt will come out of these difficult circumstances stronger than it used to be before, more confident, more united, and more stable. Our people will become much more aware of its own self- interests and more careful not to sacrifice its destiny and its stability.<br \/>   <br \/>   Hosni Mubarak, who's speaking to you today, is proud of all the long years he's spent in the service of people of Egypt. This dear country is my country, just like it is the homeland of every Egyptian man and woman.<br \/>   <br \/>   I have lived in this country. I have fought for it. I have defended its sovereignty and interest, and I will die on its land, and history will judge me and others.<br \/>   <br \/>   The homeland will remain, and people will disappear, and Egypt will always remain, and its flag will always be high. And it is our duty to achieve this with dignity and honor, generation after generation.<br \/>   <br \/>   May God protect this homeland and its people, and peace be upon you, and God's mercy and blessings.<br \/>   <br \/>   END","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-01-2011 05:39 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"2"},"24504":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110209225332im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3581"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Mubarak to stay on till election <\/font><\/font><br \/>   Egypt's president tells nation he will not seek another term, prompting protesters to resume \"Leave, Mubarak!\" chant.<\/b> <br \/>   01 Feb 2011 | Al Jazeera | <a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/news\/middleeast\/2011\/02\/201121191413252982.html\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   Tahrir Square, Cairo<br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20110209225332im_\/http:\/\/english.aljazeera.net\/mritems\/Images\/2011\/2\/1\/201121181825754633_20.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-01-2011 05:56 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"3"},"24508":{"user":{"name":"KevinL","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":"West-South-West Kitchener","member_since":"May 2010","num_posts":"499"}},"content":"Truly a watershed moment for the Arab world.

Over the past few days, the American people have watched the situation unfolding in Egypt. We&#8217;ve seen enormous demonstrations by the Egyptian people. We&#8217;ve borne witness to the beginning of a new chapter in the history of a great country, and a long-time partner of the United States.<br \/>   <br \/>    And my administration has been in close contact with our Egyptian counterparts and a broad range of the Egyptian people, as well as others across the region and across the globe. And throughout this period, we&#8217;ve stood for a set of core principles. <br \/>   <br \/>   First, we oppose violence. And I want to commend the Egyptian military for the professionalism and patriotism that it has shown thus far in allowing peaceful protests while protecting the Egyptian people. We&#8217;ve seen tanks covered with banners, and soldiers and protesters embracing in the streets. And going forward, I urge the military to continue its efforts to help ensure that this time of change is peaceful.<br \/>   <br \/>    Second, we stand for universal values, including the rights of the Egyptian people to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the freedom to access information. Once more, we&#8217;ve seen the incredible potential for technology to empower citizens and the dignity of those who stand up for a better future. And going forward, the United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Egypt and around the world.<br \/>   <br \/>    Third, we have spoken out on behalf of the need for change. After his speech tonight, I spoke directly to President Mubarak. He recognizes that the status quo is not sustainable and that a change must take place. Indeed, all of us who are privileged to serve in positions of political power do so at the will of our people. Through thousands of years, Egypt has known many moments of transformation. The voices of the Egyptian people tell us that this is one of those moments; this is one of those times.<br \/>   <br \/>    Now, it is not the role of any other country to determine Egypt&#8217;s leaders. Only the Egyptian people can do that. What is clear -- and what I indicated tonight to President Mubarak -- is my belief that an orderly transition must be meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now.<br \/>   <br \/>    Furthermore, the process must include a broad spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties. It should lead to elections that are free and fair. And it should result in a government that&#8217;s not only grounded in democratic principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the Egyptian people.<br \/>   <br \/>    Throughout this process, the United States will continue to extend the hand of partnership and friendship to Egypt. And we stand ready to provide any assistance that is necessary to help the Egyptian people as they manage the aftermath of these protests.<br \/>   <br \/>    Over the last few days, the passion and the dignity that has been demonstrated by the people of Egypt has been an inspiration to people around the world, including here in the United States, and to all those who believe in the inevitability of human freedom. <br \/>   <br \/>   To the people of Egypt, particularly the young people of Egypt, I want to be clear: We hear your voices. I have an unyielding belief that you will determine your own destiny and seize the promise of a better future for your children and your grandchildren. And I say that as someone who is committed to a partnership between the United States and Egypt.<br \/>   <br \/>   There will be difficult days ahead. Many questions about Egypt&#8217;s future remain unanswered. But I am confident that the people of Egypt will find those answers. That truth can be seen in the sense of community in the streets. It can be seen in the mothers and fathers embracing soldiers. And it can be seen in the Egyptians who linked arms to protect the national museum -- a new generation protecting the treasures of antiquity; a human chain connecting a great and ancient civilization to the promise of a new day.<br \/>   <br \/>    Thank you very much.<br \/>   <br \/>    END","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-02-2011 08:10 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"24580":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110209225332im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Senior Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3581"}},"content":"<div align=\"center\"><b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Anti-government demonstrators fear bloodbath after dark<\/font><\/font><br \/>   CNN | February 2, 2011 | <a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/news.blogs.cnn.com\/2011\/02\/02\/egypt-crisis-prepping-for-another-day-of-protests\/?hpt=T1&amp;iref=BN1\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20110209225332im_\/http:\/\/i2.cdn.turner.com\/cnn\/2011\/images\/02\/02\/t1larg.egypt.rocks1.gi.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">CNN's Hala Gorani Describes Chaos In Cairo<\/font><\/font><br \/>   CNN | February 2, 2011 | <a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/video\/#\/video\/bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/exp.gorani.tahrir.square.chaos.cnn\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">CNN Crew Attacked In Cairo<\/font><\/font><br \/>   CNN | February 2, 2011 | <a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/video\/?\/video\/bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/ac.egypt.crew.hit.cnn\" target=\"_blank\">Link<\/a><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <table><tr><td><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" \/><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/i.cdn.turner.com\/cnn\/.element\/apps\/cvp\/3.0\/swf\/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/exp.gorani.tahrir.square.chaos.cnn\" \/><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" \/><embed src=\"\/web\/20110209225332oe_\/http:\/\/i.cdn.turner.com\/cnn\/.element\/apps\/cvp\/3.0\/swf\/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/exp.gorani.tahrir.square.chaos.cnn\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"416\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"374\"><\/embed><\/td><td><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" \/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" \/><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" \/><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http:\/\/i.cdn.turner.com\/cnn\/.element\/apps\/cvp\/3.0\/swf\/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/ac.egypt.crew.hit.cnn\" \/><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\" \/><embed src=\"\/web\/20110209225332oe_\/http:\/\/i.cdn.turner.com\/cnn\/.element\/apps\/cvp\/3.0\/swf\/cnn_416x234_embed.swf?context=embed&amp;videoId=bestoftv\/2011\/02\/02\/ac.egypt.crew.hit.cnn\" type=\"application\/x-shockwave-flash\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"416\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"374\"><\/embed><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/div>","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110209225332\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/969-Groundhog-Day-Meet-Up\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"sienna\">Groundhog Day Meet-Up | February 2nd 7-9PM @ KW Art Gallery<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"02-02-2011 11:06 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"6"},"24581":{"user":{"name":"Waterlooer","avatar":"\/web\/20110209225332im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=284&amp;dateline=1288713241","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Waterloo, ON","member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"502"}},"content":"Watching CNN and LOTS of molotov cocktails are being thrown by the pro-government citizens.

\/>    <br \/>    The buildings were purchased to accommodate the increase in students who have been promised residence rooms for the 2009-10 academic year.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;While we&#8217;ve got a problem, it&#8217;s a more manageable problem. The kids who will be in the new buildings will just love it. They&#8217;re brand new and very spacious,&#8221; said director of residential services Mike Belanger.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;Looking at it from a distance point of view, its only a five to seven minute walk to campus. It might be only marginally further than University Place [residence] to the centre of campus.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    The new buildings will be priced comparably to Laurier&#8217;s high-end accommodations such as King Street Residence, which costs $5,966 for a single room.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"red\">The university will be taking occupancy on August 15 and has signed a 20 and a half-month lease on the two buildings.<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    According to Belanger, however, Laurier only wants the buildings for the eight months first-year students are in school.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The people who own these places wanted a long term lease, but we didn&#8217;t want that. We&#8217;re looking into other solutions,&#8221; said Belanger.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We will hope that there will be some new building going up, so we can do the same kind of leasing arrangement again for the new number [of we will need.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    <font color=\"red\"><b>The conditions for Laurier to pull out of the lease after the end of April require the university to give the owner of the building the equivalent number of students to continue living in the residence for their second year.<\/b><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It will be a bit of a marketing campaign beginning in October\/November,&#8221; said Belanger. &#8220;But we don&#8217;t think we will have much trouble filling them.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Belanger says that the rent for students continuing to reside after their residence contract is fulfilled will be comparable with the competitive high-end student housing in the city.<br \/>    <br \/>    Students will also be able to lease single or double rooms and will not have to fill an entire unit.<br \/>    <br \/>    <font color=\"red\"><b>The owners of the building have the intention of putting a restaurant and bar on the ground level of the larger building, but it will not begin construction until after Laurier is out of the lease, as Belanger feels it would be too hard to control with first-years living in the building.<\/b><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    In order to maintain the same level of quality and experience for first-years, a number of things are being done to deal with the increasing numbers.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We added a new co-ordinator this year, along with more dons to make sure that the experience stays the same,&#8221; said Chris Dodd, manager of housing services and residence life.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;If we can keep our staff ratio the same, we expect to be able to deliver the same level of service.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    Last year, there was a similar problem, as there were also too many students for the amount of beds available in residences.<br \/>    <br \/>    When this happens, the university does have some room to adjust internally by converting large single rooms into doubles and pushing senior, graduate and international students farther from campus to make more room for first-years.<br \/>    <br \/>    This year, residence life will not offer students bunk beds in Bricker residence, which was one of the solutions for the problem last year.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">345 King Street North <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109215618\/http:\/\/www.mylaurier.ca\/residence\/info\/resbldgs\/wluresidences\/345king.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.mylaurier.ca\/residence\/in...es\/345king.htm<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109215618\/http:\/\/www.mylaurier.ca\/content\/documents\/Image\/Residence%20Life\/345King.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"\/web\/20131109215618im_\/http:\/\/i196.photobucket.com\/albums\/aa262\/AndrewEH\/Waterloo\/345%20King%20Street%20North\/WLU-345King.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><br \/>    <font size=\"1\"><a href=\"\/web\/20131109215618\/http:\/\/www.mylaurier.ca\/content\/documents\/Image\/Residence%20Life\/345King.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Click For Larger Image<\/a><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    The student residence located at 345 King Street North is a newly-constructed 14-storey building leased by Wilfrid Laurier University for the academic year starting in September 2009.

Mark Whaley. &quot;It's pretty marvellous.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   Plans for the complex on about five hectares (12.7 acres) of the former Canbar lands at Erb Street and Father David Bauer Drive include:<br \/>   Two 25-storey condominium towers;<br \/>   Four apartment towers, two 21-storeys high, one 18 storeys high, one 12 storeys high;<br \/>   12 townhouses;<br \/>   10 lowrise mixed-use residential and retail units;<br \/>   Two hotels with 280 rooms;<br \/>   230,000 sq-ft of commercial office and retail space;<br \/>   2,250 parking spaces, most of which would be in a two-level underground garage.<br \/>   The project was the first major development proposal approved by the new council, which earlier this year supported plans to redevelop a parking lot at Waterloo Town Square into a public square.<br \/>   The city scrapped a height and density cap that would have restricted the apartment buildings and condominiums to no higher than seven storeys.<br \/>   <br \/>   Instead, the developer is planning several highrise buildings along Father David Bauer Drive.<br \/>   Yesterday's council approval signalled an end to a decade-long debate on the property between the city and residents who wanted to keep their low-rise leafy streets from becoming a crowded city core overrun with traffic.<br \/>   In 1998, Canbar asked the city to change its zoning restrictions in order to turn the site, which once held its fibreglass and plastics manufacturing business, into a commercial and residential complex. The company hoped to sell the land to a developer that would build a series of highrise apartments, hotels and business space. But those plans were scuttled after residents balked at bringing Toronto-style development and traffic into the quiet suburban core.<br \/>   <br \/>   The company scaled back its plans and Auburn Developments bought the site in 2005. The land had undergone an environmental cleanup and passed a 2003 Ministry of the Environment audit.<br \/>   The BarrelYards is the largest project that Auburn has undertaken, said company president Jamie Crich. The company is also developing the Arrow Lofts in Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   Plans for the project were scaled up from original concept, which was for 750 apartments and condos in mostly low-rise buildings, a 120-room boutique hotel and mostly above-ground parking.<br \/>   Construction could start as early as this fall and would take between four and seven years, depending on how strong the market is for the project, Crich said in an interview.<br \/>   But he said he's confident there is strong interest in a massive development in Waterloo and that his company has been flooded with calls from interested residents and businesses.<br \/>   <br \/>   &quot;You can't do everything overnight, but there is definitely a good strong market here. The city's done a great job with their Uptown and people are responding. They want to live there.&quot;<br \/>   Local companies have long been pushing for a downtown Waterloo hotel and conference centre. Yesterday, Crich said the company is proposing both a long- and short-stay hotel, and would push for conference facilities.<br \/>   Auburn has been getting as many as five calls a day from interested hotel chains since putting out a request. The hotels would be built by the hotel chains themselves.<br \/>   He wouldn't name the potential hotel operators, but Crich said they were &quot;some five-star hotels. Great brands have expressed an interest in being here.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   Both the city and the developer said they would ask the region to make some road improvements, such as traffic lights and left-turn lanes, to Erb Street, said consultant Chris Pidgeon of GSP Group.<br \/>   The developer isn't expecting the region to support the proposed changes, Pidgeon said, but they are critical to building the hotels.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city is still negotiating to share the cost of about $100,000 in improvements to Father David Bauer Drive, such as landscaped medium and bike lanes on both sides.<br \/>   John Shortreed, who lives on neighbouring Euclid Avenue, was concerned that the city was approving zoning changes before knowing the region would support road improvements to protect residents and pedestrians from an onslaught of new traffic. &quot;It's a huge impact on a very small neighbourhood,&quot; he said.<br \/>   Mike Hudson, who also lives on Euclid, was concerned the proposed highrise condos and apartments would destroy the natural skyline of Waterloo Park. &quot;We should consider what it is about Waterloo Park that makes it special and try and see if that can be preserved,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it can be preserved in its current form with very large office towers immediately adjacent to the park.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   The proposal doesn't include any affordable housing, but a staff report said the developer plans to look into any low-cost housing opportunities and that creating luxury units would free up affordable housing elsewhere in the city.<br \/>   Uptown Coun. Ian McLean said the project shows Waterloo is a leader in intensifying in its downtown. &quot;Because we're running out of land, we will continue to be a leader and show Kitchener and Cambridge and other parts of the region how to intensify in a way that respects our existing neighbourhoods and provides for our future,&quot; he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\">Waterloo's BarrelYards gets council's go-ahead<\/font><\/b><br \/>   September 10, 2008 <br \/>   LIZ MONTEIRO, RECORD STAFF<br \/>   WATERLOO<br \/>   <br \/>   A $250-million uptown development with two condo towers, apartments and a luxury hotel, finally has the go-ahead from Waterloo.<br \/>   An agreement covering the BarrelYards project got unanimous approval this week from city councillors.<br \/>   Construction will start in the spring, Jaime Crich, president of the London-based development firm, told council.<br \/>   <br \/>   The project includes 1,000 residential units on the former Canbar lands and a $20-million hotel, which has yet to be named.<br \/>   &quot;This will change the face of our community like never before,'' Coun.

Ian McLean called the city's agreement with Auburn &quot;a true collaboration.&quot;<br \/>   It's not yet clear whether the BarrelYards project will affect a second hotel proposed for Waterloo, this one for a Westin Hotel on Willis Way between King and Caroline streets.<br \/>   <br \/>   Whaley and MacLean both said they believe the developer, First Gulf Development Corp., continues to meet with city staff to talk about the Westin proposal.<br \/>   &quot;As far as I know, negotiations between the city team and First Gulf are still going on,&quot; Whaley said.<br \/>   First Gulf Corp., which has asked the city to pay for most of a parking garage as part of the hotel proposal, could not be reached for comment. The parking proposal would cost the city $3.6 million, but McLean said he's sure First Gulf knows the city doesn't like the plan.<br \/>   The city's total contribution to the BarrelYards project is estimated at $730,203.<br \/>   <br \/>   Plans for the complex on about five hectares at Erb Street and Father David Bauer Drive include:<br \/>   Two condominium towers 25 storeys high, two apartment towers 21 storeys high, one 18 storeys high and one 12 storeys high;<br \/>   12 townhouses;<br \/>   160,000 square feet of retail and commercial office space;<br \/>   2,000 parking spaces -- 1,600 underground in a two-level parking garage and 400 surface spots.<br \/>   The seven-storey hotel will have 150 rooms, including 38 apartment-style suites for extended stays. The hotel will also feature a pool, a restaurant and a conference facility for up to 200 people.<br \/>   <br \/>   An announcement naming the hotel will be made next month, said Michael Siskind of Decade Group, a real estate development company in Toronto. Siskind said the hotel will meet the needs of sophisticated business travellers.<br \/>   &quot;People should not have to leave the uptown area,'' he said in an interview.<br \/>   The hotel is expected to open by 2010.<br \/>   The first part of the BarrelYards project will be erecting a 21-storey apartment building along Father David Bauer Drive this spring.<br \/>   Ryan Mounsey, the city development planner, said it took nearly a year for the city and Auburn to iron out financial details, including a cost-sharing plan to bury hydro.<br \/>   &quot;This is a landmark project with significance for the City of Waterloo,'' he told councillors.<br \/>   The total cost to bury the hydro is $790,738. The developer will pay for 50 per cent of the cost, while the city and Waterloo North Hydro will each pay 25 per cent. The city's share of the hydro work amounts to $197,684.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city will also pay to widen Father David Bauer Drive, improve street lighting and plant trees. The money will come from development charges and the capital reserve fund, Mounsey said.<br \/>   The developer went &quot;above and beyond&quot; what was necessary to make the project successful, he said.<br \/>   Additional costs to be paid by the developer include a landscape median and a pedestrian promenade with trees, decorative concrete and street furniture.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\">BarrelYards plan a boost for Waterloo<\/font><\/b><br \/>   September 15, 2008 <br \/>   THE RECORD<br \/>   <br \/>   The recently approved BarrelYards project in Waterloo is one of the most impressive developments in Waterloo Region, if not in the entire province.<br \/>   It is a massive project that both reflects the change that has occurred in the region and will also contribute to the changes that will take place in the future.<br \/>   Waterloo city councillors gave the go-ahead to Auburn Developments' plan last week for the BarrelYards project on the former Canbar property at Erb Street and Father David Bauer Drive. It is a massive undertaking that will cost about $250-million.<br \/>   <br \/>   Just consider what is on the planning board that should become real in the years ahead: two condo towers, apartments and a luxury hotel. The two condominium towers will be 25 storeys high, two apartment towers will be 21 storeys high, one will have 18 storeys and another one will have 12.<br \/>   There will also be 12 townhouses. Current residents of Waterloo will be particularly interested in the $20-million hotel Auburn wants to build. It should be a real asset to the city.<br \/>   <br \/>   Coun. Mark Whaley was not exaggerating when he said, &quot;This will change the face of our community like never before.&quot;<br \/>   This project reflects a trend that has been going on for some time. The City of Waterloo is booming. It is a city that is doing exceptionally well in a region that is doing well by any standard.<br \/>   Cambridge, for example, has supported Hasstown Holdings's plan to build 230 luxury condominiums on a property along the Grand River, and Kitchener has been working with Andrin Investments Ltd. on the Centre Block project, but nothing really compares to the BarrelYards project, which is so close to Waterloo's core.<br \/>   <br \/>   This is an ideal example of a city agreeing to put residential and commercial units on land previously used for industrial purposes.<br \/>   Auburn Developments' plan complements First Gulf Corp.'s redevelopment of the Waterloo Town Square. Bit by bit, First Gulf has changed what had become a dowdy, out-of-date retail property. The stores facing King Street and other changes on the property have given the core the fresh face it needed.<br \/>   <br \/>   Interestingly, it wasn't that many years ago when Waterloo went through the trauma of losing its longtime core businesses, Seagrams and Labatts. When those companies left, few city residents would have believed the core would have the future that is unfolding now.<br \/>   <br \/>   There are three related reasons behind the new developments that are springing up in Waterloo: The growth of the city's two universities in general, the University of Waterloo's focus on computer studies, and the burgeoning of high tech companies, some of which grew out of the University of Waterloo.<br \/>   The success of Waterloo's high-tech sector creates demand for a host of other services and goods, which in turn creates jobs in other sectors of the economy. Both the high-tech employees and the people who serve them need the facilities Auburn plans to build on the Canbar property.<br \/>   This project will cement Waterloo's reputation as a growing, attractive community, and should attract even more attention to the city.

At present, Waterloo&#8217;s hotels are designed to suit travellers on more moderate budgets. The current hotels, of course, serve their market well but they do not particularly cater to the top end of market.<br \/>   To be sure, there have been many attempts over the years to build a top-notch hotel, but the plans never got beyond being plans. <br \/>   As recently as the spring, Gulf Development Corp. dropped its proposal to build a luxury hotel on Willis Way between King and Caroline streets. Gulf Development wanted Waterloo council to make more of a financial commitment to the project than it was willing to make. <br \/>   <br \/>   Now, however, Decade Group Inc. has announced that it wants to build a hotel in the BarrelYards project at Erb Street and Father David Bauer Drive. The hotel would be part of a large $250-million development announced last year for the former Canbar property. In addition to a hotel, the development will also have condominium and apartment units. <br \/>   <br \/>   Bob Siskind of the Decade Group said the company wants the hotel to be a &#8220;landmark destination.&#8221; The Decade Group would like council to approve the hotel by the end of the year. If that happens, the hotel might open in the spring of 2011.<br \/>   <br \/>   This hotel, assuming the Decade Group succeeds in building it, represents a form of coming of age for the city of Waterloo. It is a significant piece in the redevelopment puzzle of the city&#8217;s core, known as the uptown area. A superb hotel would quickly gain a reputation both in the region and elsewhere as being a short-term home for affluent visitors to the region.<br \/>   Waterloo&#8217;s core is a long, long way from the core that was once the home of large manufacturing industries such as Seagram&#8217;s and Labatt&#8217;s. Furthermore, the new high-tech companies that have moved into Waterloo have more than filled the void created when those firms closed their doors.<br \/>   <br \/>   Waterloo&#8217;s core might have suffered a rather embarrassing setback because many Waterloo residents criticized the city&#8217;s council for the way it planned the public square at King Street at Willis Way. Some residents &#8212; particularly skateboarders &#8212; saw the square as nothing but a skateboard park. But most of the critics are quibbling with what council decided to do with the land, not whether it should have done something to try to enhance the core. They just wish the city had implemented a different plan in what is clearly a subjective field. <br \/>   <br \/>   Significantly, the Decade Group announced its intention to build its hotel during a recession. That decision can be interpreted in no other way than as a vote of confidence in the future of the city and the region.<br \/>   Of course, this recession has hurt many businesses, but, apparently, the Decade Group believes that this part of Ontario has great potential to become even more prosperous than it is. No development company is going to build a luxury hotel in an economically depressed area.<br \/>   For the sake of the city and the region, let us hope that the Decade Group&#8217;s plan does become a reality and that a first-rate hotel opens it doors in 2011.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   ---<br \/>   <br \/>   Domain Hotel Media <a href=\"\/web\/20131109221820\/http:\/\/www.domainhotel.ca\/pdf\/pressrelease-july13.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Release 1<\/a><br \/>   Domain Hotel Media <a href=\"\/web\/20131109221820\/http:\/\/www.domainhotel.ca\/pdf\/pressrelease-sept8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Release 2 <\/a>","signature":"","date":"01-29-2010 12:41 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"07-15-2010 07:38 PM","user":"Spokes"},"num_in_thread":"5"},"1324":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109221820im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=24&amp;dateline=1290460886","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"744"}},"content":"Wow, I'm surprised a thread for this development hasn't been created yet.

I do have a few complaints about the project besides the never ending timeline. I wish the hotel had more of a street presence along Erb, and that it had a unique look to it, unlike the suburban feel that it does have. I would have liked to see some trails running through the project to connect to Waterloo Park (as discussed at the Uptown waterloo visions meeting). I don't know about anyone else but I also like that office building render that is on the sign in front of the lot, maybe a little more glass but I think it looks fairly unique for this region. But at the same time I like the atrium that connects the two mixed use buildings. I just hope the project happens, for one thing it will add a lot of residents to the uptown core, it will add a tremendous amount of height to the uptown skyline, and it gives uptown a key mix use project. I would like to see what sort of green initiatives they are planning. This is the type of development big enough that they should be trying for a green source of power (like solar, or geothermal) to power a percentage of the project.<br \/>    <br \/>    One other thing is the development is so massive and so important to Waterloo but Auburn hardly has any information available on their website about the project. I also find it odd about Auburn that there is no condo sales office set up on the site, or no details about the different layouts, prices, amenities available at the buildings (very similar to The Arrow Lofts project). Also the hotel plan changed drastically from two seperate hotels for long and short stays to one hotel, so I am hoping if any other details of this development change that they are positives.","signature":"","date":"01-29-2010 10:13 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"1347":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109221820im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=5&amp;dateline=1268703480","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"681"}},"content":"I know...I almost don't want to get my hopes up..I agree the hotel design could be better.

But even if the apartment buildings are constructed first, you would think they would start trying to sell units ahead of time because two 25 storey condominiums hold alot of units, which is great for Uptown or atleast advertise the price range and unit sizes or something to give people who are interested in buying at the property an idea of what they are looking at.

The reason the King St. block is &#8220;ugly&#8221; rests with the fact those buildings create a hostile pedestrian environment by having zero street level interaction, no allocation for a streetwall with all the space between buildings (as example Toronto zoning forces streetwalls), a lack of sidewalk setback from the street and too much building setback from the sidewalk. These streetwall and canyon wall effects are all good urbanism concepts that are proven to slow traffic, improve pedestrian safety and encourage pedestrian use. All things you are advocating for on this forum. All are being applied to this project (with 144 Park), just not as rigorously as most of the forum users would like. You cannot compare King St. N to this.<br \/>   <br \/>   I live on Alexandra Ave (mere blocks from this development) and would greatly welcome this new tower along with all its neighbour and the traffic it may bring. Being an Uptown resident means I walk or bike for virtually all my amenities and take the Iron Horse at minimum every 3 to 4 weeks as my haircuts happen downtown Kitchener. I look forward to the LRT in every way and cannot wait for high rise towers (with ground level retail) I hope it will bring to replace of all the surface parking on Caroline.

and Vision for Kitchener&#8217;s Downtown Centre Block<\/b><br \/>   Andrin envisions a dynamic, inspiring, sustainable and engaging redevelopment<br \/>   concept for the Centre Block, consisting of a mixed-use complex, combining:<br \/>   <ul><li style=\"\">A total of up to 401 residential units, offering a range of residential suite types, including lofts, affordable condominiums, larger family oriented dwellings, live\/work units and penthouses.<\/li><li style=\"\">Vibrant new retail spaces along King Street.<\/li><li style=\"\">A multi-level underground parking structure for up to 714 spaces, with public parking and parking for the retail users at the first level and secure residential parking on the lower level(s).<\/li><li style=\"\">A boutique hotel and spa in the restored and renovated heritage structures at the corner of Duke and Young Streets.<\/li><li style=\"\">A public\/private courtyard with linkages from Duke Street, Young Street and the underground public parking structure. A linkage from King Street to the courtyard will be provided through a public galleria.<\/li><li style=\"\">A design that will strive for architectural excellence and be:<\/li><\/ul><br \/>   <div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><ul><li style=\"\">Compatible with the existing physical, heritage and social context of the site, including restoration and redevelopment of the existing heritage structures into a boutique hotel and spa;<\/li><li style=\"\">Responsive to angular planes to minimize shadow impacts;<\/li><li style=\"\">Address positively the existing City Hall to the west;<\/li><li style=\"\">Enhance the main street qualities of the three street frontages;<\/li><li style=\"\">Provide opportunities for outdoor animated uses such as caf\u00e9s on King Street West; and<\/li><li style=\"\">Overall safety and security within the site will be an important element of design considerations.<\/li><\/ul><\/div><br \/>   <b>Andrin&#8217;s Development Team<\/b><br \/>   For the redevelopment of the Centre Block, Andrin has assembled a team of talented and experienced professionals to work with the City of Kitchener on this collaborative venture. These include; Kimshaw Holdings (A partner in Kaufman Lofts), Quadrangle Architects (The architect for Kaufman Lofts), GSP Planning Group of Kitchener, PMA Sales and Marketing (who sold-out both Kaufman and Bauer Lofts simultaneously). As a developer, Andrin has worked previously with all of the above and we pride ourselves on the effective teamwork of our approach. <br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Andrin&#8217;s Previous Experience<\/b><br \/>   Andrin has extensive experience in downtown redevelopment projects, including: Wellington Terrace in downtown Burlington; Carter Square in Hamilton, Union Village in old downtown Brampton; Neeve Street Housing Development on the banks of the Speed River in downtown Guelph; South Side on Lamar in Dallas, Texas and Kitchener&#8217;s Kaufman Lofts. The Kaufman Lofts alone have won several awards including: the Canadian Urban Institute&#8217;s prestigious &#8220;Brownie&#8221; award for &#8220;Best Project&#8221; (2005) and the Waterloo Regional Home Builders&#8217; Association awards for &#8220;Best Re-urbanization Project&#8221; and &#8220;Project of the Year&#8221; (2006).<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>How does Andrin&#8217;s proposal meet the Community&#8217;s Vision For Centre Block?<\/b><br \/>   Andrin&#8217;s redevelopment of Centre Block will create a main street destination that will create a vibrant people place for all of Kitchener to experience. The landscape courtyard, with pedestrian linkages, will offer a safe and enjoyable environment for a mid-day break, an evening stroll or early morning exercise. Industrial artifacts recalling Kitchener&#8217;s past will be placed in the courtyard and gallery to contribute a public art element to the project. A caf\u00e9 will spill out onto the new tree-lined promenade on this stretch of King Street, and also into the adjacent sky-lit gallery and will make the perfect meeting place for friends and business colleagues.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>What is Andrin&#8217;s Proposal for the Two Existing Buildings on the Property?<\/b><br \/>   Andrin proposes to renovate the existing Mayfair Hotel and adjacent building to create an upscale boutique hotel and spa. Andrin has an excellent working relationship with Heritage Kitchener from their experience at Kaufman Lofts and will work closely with the committee to ensure the buildings are revitalized in a manner consistent with heritage by-laws and policies.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>When Would Construction Begin on the Proposal, and When Would it End?<\/b><br \/>   Andrin&#8217;s proposal anticipates the first phase of the redevelopment, including a portion of the underground parking structure, residential tower, a podium building and King Street retail to begin construction in the fall of 2008. The second phase of the redevelopment, including the balance of the parking structure, residential tower, the second podium building and landscaped courtyard to begin construction in the spring of 2009. Construction on the final phase, the boutique hotel and spa, would start in the spring of 2010. Andrin anticipates that all three phases of the Centre Block redevelopment will be complete by the Spring of 2011.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>How Does Andrin&#8217;s Proposal Contribute the City&#8217;s Green Agenda?<\/b><br \/>   The buildings will be designed to incorporate the highest levels of environmental measures and sustainable development features that are feasible, and be eligible for LEED certification. Some of these features will include a green roof, upgraded building envelopes, enhanced building systems, the use of local building materials and trades, the remediation of the existing site and maximizing the use of local transit systems.<br \/>   <br \/>   <b>Andrin&#8217;s Proposal for Parking<\/b><br \/>   Three levels of parking are incorporated under the landscaped courtyard at the centre of the site. The uppermost level will be dedicated to public parking, with the second and third levels designated for the condominium residents and visitors. Pedestrian access to the public parking level is provided from Young Street, King Street and Duke Street. Vehicles using the public parking area will enter from Duke Street while residents will have a separate entrance off Young Street.","signature":"","date":"12-24-2009 03:16 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"07-15-2010 07:48 PM","user":"Spokes"},"num_in_thread":"2"},"21":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<font color=\"Blue\"><b><u><font size=\"4\">Centre Block deal delayed <\/font><\/u><\/b><\/font><br \/>   <b>Redevelopment negotiations to go into 2008<\/b><br \/>   November 23, 2007 <br \/>   JEFF OUTHIT - RECORD STAFF - KITCHENER<br \/>   <br \/>   Negotiators will miss a fall deadline to conclude the latest redevelopment proposal for the heart of downtown.<br \/>   <br \/>   Instead, <font color=\"Red\"><b>Centre Block talks between city hall and Andrin Homes will continue into 2008.<\/b><\/font> <img src=\"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/frown.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Frown\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/> <br \/>   <br \/>   \"There's a fair breadth of discussion going on related to the parking and to other aspects of the project,\" said city bureaucrat Rod Regier, chair of the city negotiating committee.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"It's a much more complicated exercise than we all imagined,\" Andrin president Peter Smith said. \"A lot of it relates to the phasing of the underground parking.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   <font color=\"red\"><b>Both parties said negotiations are not in jeopardy. \"We're not fighting with the city here,\" Smith said.<\/b><\/font> <img src=\"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/smile.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Smile\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/> <br \/>   <br \/>   \"We mutually agreed to extend the deadline, so we could make sure we did our homework right the first time.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   Council is negotiating with Andrin to erect two residential towers, a hotel, public parking, retail space and a landscaped courtyard on city-owned land east of city hall.<br \/>   <br \/>   The proposal has an estimated value of up to $90 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   Negotiations were planned to conclude this fall.<br \/>   <br \/>   Issues still in debate behind closed doors include the value of the city contribution and the city's bid to secure 250 underground parking spaces.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"Everybody is doing their due diligence and being cautious and making sure that once an agreement is in place, it's best for both parties,\" Mayor Carl Zehr said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Kitchener council has proposed contributing an undetermined amount of money and just over one hectare of mostly vacant land.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city spent $9.1 million to buy land and buildings and compensate business owners.<br \/>   <br \/>   Council selected Andrin as a potential Centre Block partner after inviting redevelopment proposals.<br \/>   <br \/>   Andrin is redeveloping the Kaufman building into residential lofts in downtown Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   It has been involved in other redevelopment projects in Ontario and in Texas.<br \/>   <br \/>   Councillors intend to say yes or no to the Andrin proposal based on the overall use of the site, open space, parking and use of existing buildings.<br \/>   <br \/>   Smith warned that even if a deal is reached with the city, Andrin has to pre-sell up to 80 per cent of its 12-storey tower to launch a first phase.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"I can't build unless I can sell units,\" he said.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We think there's a market there now.

The company must also pre-sell 60 to 70 per cent of the 384 condominiums it plans for the site before construction begins. Work could start next spring.<br \/>   <br \/>   It would take four years to finish the $90-million project, which includes two condo towers and shorter buildings that would wrap around Duke, Young and King streets. An underground parking garage with 750 spaces and a courtyard are also planned.<br \/>   <br \/>   A committee of staff and citizens, formed in early 2007, has evaluated the plan and endorsed it.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"I think it is very important to get some high-quality housing in the Kitchener core,\" said committee member Rick Haldenby, the director of the University of Waterloo school of architecture.<br \/>   <br \/>   Andrin wants to convert the historic Mayfair building into a boutique hotel and spa. Retail and live-work units are slated for the three-storey buildings fronting Duke, Young and King streets. The renovation of two other historic addresses on King is also part of the plan. \"We need a social and cultural mix in the core, and I think this has the potential to draw people to live downtown,\" Haldenby said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city spent $9.1 million to assemble the land and buy out several businesses. The figure includes $7.65 million for the land and businesses and $1.45 million on legal fees, closing costs and consultants.<br \/>   <br \/>   Under the proposed deal, Andrin will pay the city $3.1 million -- $2.3 million for the vacant land, $100,000 for a strip of land along King Street and $700,000 for the historic buildings at 11 Young St. and at 156-158 King St.<br \/>   <br \/>   The 250 parking spaces would cost $35,000 each, for a total of $8.75 million, said Dan Chapman, acting city treasurer.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city has $5.5 million earmarked for the parking from its economic development investment fund. That, coupled with the funds from the sale of land and buildings to Andrin, would be used to pay for the parking spaces.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"So our estimate right now is that we are about $400,000 short in funding, but we are still in negotiations with Andrin,\" Chapman said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The city is on the hook to provide 175 parking spaces to Wilfrid Laurier University students and faculty for $20 a month per space. This was part of the deal negotiated to attract the school of social work to the downtown.<br \/>   <br \/>   Andrin is no stranger to Kitchener. It partnered with Kimshaw Holdings to convert the former Kaufman factory into condominiums. That project cost more than $40 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   When the city sought proposals for the redevelopment of Centre Block, three companies submitted plans by April 2007 -- Morguard Investments, the Windmill Development Group and Andrin.

In total, the city spent about $9.1 million to buy the land, businesses and pay associated fees for lawyers and consultants.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"This is the type of development we have been looking for and it is now on our table,\" Zehr said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The proposal calls for two mid-rise buildings containing about 385 condominiums. A 16-storey building will be constructed at Duke and Young streets, and a 12-storey building off King Street.<br \/>   <br \/>   A four-storey building will wrap around Duke and Young streets. Another four storey building will be built along that block's now-vacant stretch of King Street.<br \/>   <br \/>   A public courtyard will be built in the centre of the block, and an underground-parking garage with 750 spaces will be built. The first floor of that garage will have 250 spaces for the public. The city will buy those spaces from Andrin for $8.75 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"Quite frankly I am very pleased,\" Coun. John Gazzola said.<br \/>   <br \/>   A development agreement must be negotiated between the city and Andrin. Once that is in place Andrin will begin pre-selling condos. If all goes well construction could begin next spring.<br \/>   <br \/>   Andrin is well know to city officials as that company did the $40 million conversion of the old Kaufman factory into condominiums.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We really look forward to working with you and creating a great development for our downtown,\" Coun. Geoff Lorentz said.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"I think this will be a real boost for our downtown core, and it will certainly add a lot of character and excitement to our downtown, which we really need,\" Lorentz said.<br \/>   <br \/>   In 1998, the year before the city started buying land on Centre Block, the land and businesses there produced $35,000 in city taxes. Once the proposed development is completed it will produce an estimated $390,000-a-year in city taxes, and another $800,000 annually to be split among Waterloo Region and the two school boards.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"Fundamentally this is going to bring significant new dollars to our community,\" Coun. Berry Vrbanovic said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Peter Smith, the head of Andrin Investments spelled out the timelines for city councillors.<br \/>   <br \/>   The first phase would see the buildings constructed at Duke and Ontario streets, along with part of the underground garage. The second phase includes the buildings on the King Street side of the block, and the rest of the underground-parking garage. The third phase is the conversion of the Mayfair building into a boutique hotel and spa.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"My guess is that would be over a five or six year period, with phase one being about 24 months, phase two being about 24 to 36 months and the Mayfair following after that,\" Smith said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Smith said Andrin must pre-sell 70 to 75 per cent of the condos before construction begins.","signature":"","date":"12-24-2009 03:32 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"07-15-2010 07:45 PM","user":"Spokes"},"num_in_thread":"3"},"22":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<b><font color=\"Red\">August 6, 2008 - the day this sign went up:<\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Kitchener\/City%20Centre%20Condominiums\/CityCentreSign-August62008-2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Kitchener\/City%20Centre%20Condominiums\/CityCentreSign-August62008-1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <font color=\"red\"><b>August 8, 2008 @ the Kitchener Blues Festival:<\/b><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Kitchener\/City%20Centre%20Condominiums\/SDC10761.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/>","signature":"","date":"12-24-2009 03:46 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"4"},"23":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Fiscal chill stalls Centre Block<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    October 29, 2008 <br \/>    Terry Pender, RECORD STAFF - KITCHENER<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109234429\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/CanadaWorld\/article\/435820\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Canad...article\/435820<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    The worldwide financial crisis will delay by six to eight months the start of the long-awaited redevelopment of downtown Kitchener's Centre Block.<br \/>    <br \/>    Peter Smith of Andrin Homes, the Brampton-based developer behind the $90-million plan, said the company will launch a campaign after next June to pre-sell the approximately 385 condominiums planned for the site.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The market is sluggish right now, we all know that, not just in Kitchener but throughout the area,\" Smith said in a telephone interview yesterday.<br \/>    <br \/>    Plans call for four new buildings on the block bounded by King, Young, Duke and Ontario streets.

Nevertheless, it alone does not mean the buildings will be saved. As the councillors know, a similar heritage designation did not save the former Forsyth shirt factory, which was also on the Centre Block.<br \/>    <br \/>    After it acquired the Forsyth building, the city let it deteriorate until the chief building official issued a demolition order. The building came down in 2006, earning the city the condemnation of the Heritage Canada Foundation.<br \/>    <br \/>    Let's hope the city does a better job of protecting the Mayfair Hotel and the Hymmen building.

Andrin&#8217;s proposal met all of the criteria set out in the Centre Block Terms of Reference adopted by Council in October 2006. The company proposed a high-quality mixed-use development which includes diverse residential development, ground floor retail, combinations of safe, connected public and private outdoor spaces. They have proposed the allocation of 250 parking spaces in a portion of the underground structure to be retained in City ownership at a competitive cost.<br \/>    <br \/>    The project sets a new standard for architecture and urban design for a high density residential project in the Waterloo Region. It achieves maximum density on the site and makes a significant contribution to Kitchener&#8217;s downtown as a vibrant urban place by attracting new residents and contributing to an improved balance between employment and residents in the downtown. The proposal addresses the City's requirement for Leadership in Energy and Environmental design (LEED), supporting Kitchener's Environmental Strategy. It also advances the objectives of the City&#8217;s Economic Development Strategy, Economic Development Investment Fund by creating a new magnet for talented young people and investment, strengthening the brand of Downtown Kitchener.<br \/>    <br \/>    The developer has a track record of high quality reurbanization projects in Kitchener, the Greater Toronto Area and in the United States. They have the financial, technical and marketing expertise to successfully build this project.<br \/>    <br \/>    Andrin&#8217;s proposal was subjected to a rigorous public consultation process.

It&#8217;s the kind of connection that&#8217;s caught the attention of the marketing department at the City of Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   The City of Kitchener is targeting young high-tech workers in its marketing campaign for downtown living. It&#8217;s paying dividends, as many high-tech workers bought space in the Kaufman Lofts. Open Text recently announced it is constructing another building in the research park and hiring another 800 people.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;The growing number of knowledge workers in high-tech bodes well for this product,&#8221; Regier said.<br \/>   <br \/>   The successful condo developments on Mansion Street and at the farmers&#8217; market on King Street East help the city in its marketing of downtown to both developers and buyers.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;I get the sense that interest is building in condos downtown,&#8221; Regier said.<br \/>   <br \/>   Prompted by word that a pornographic movie house was set to open there, the city bought several buildings and businesses clustered around the western half of Centre Block. By 2000 it had 2.6 acres of land and several buildings. So far the city has spent about $13 million.<br \/>   <br \/>   City councillors voted to sell that land to Andrin for $3.1 million. The city will also provide $5.5 million to help pay for the construction of the three-level underground parking garage, the first level of which will be for public parking.<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"mailto:tpender@therecord.com\">tpender@therecord.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"12-24-2009 06:17 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"07-15-2010 07:48 PM","user":"Spokes"},"num_in_thread":"8"},"109":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4277"}},"content":"Is this one still proposed or has it been officially approved yet?","signature":"","date":"12-27-2009 12:18 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"9"},"489":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109234429im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=20&amp;dateline=1263145529","title":"Sports & Recreation Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Jan 2010","num_posts":"1387"}},"content":"I have a question, what is the expected floor count and height of the two towers?

But what I have seen is a lot of misinformation about Rapid Bus Transit, and a lot of unfounded fear of an cost that we cannot handle.<br \/>   <br \/>   For those of you who support the Rapid Bus Transit plan I ask you these questions. Why is the Rapid Bus option the better plan? In what ways will it benefit the Region in the coming years of growth? How will it scale with a much larger population in 10 years? I have not heard anyone in support of the Rapid Bus plan answer any of these questions without quoting the cost difference between Light Rail and Bus Rapid.<br \/>   <br \/>   Light Rail Transit will offer great scaling in the years of growth to the Region of Waterloo. Although Light Rail Transit does have a bigger base cost it does scale a lot better and the difference in cost is not much. Rapid bus will cost us $100 million right now and Light Rail will cost us $235 million right now. But a rapid bus costs $10,000 with a $8,000\/year maintenance cost while Light Rail car costs $20,000 with a $2,000\/year maintenance cost. The Light Rail Transit option also includes replacing a large amount of underground piping that would need to be replaced eventually.<br \/>   <br \/>   Although the Rapid Bus plan may seem attractive it won't scale very well which is a lesson that we learned from Ottawa whom is currently replacing their Rapid Buses with a subway system. Rapid Buses may serve the region for a short time but eventually it's going to need to be replaced by a new system. Why not spend the little bit of extra money now for Light Rail Transit instead of having to pay a much higher cost for Light Rail or even worse a Subway System in 10-15 years.<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/member.php\/620-bzmwillemsen\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Willemsen<\/a><br \/>   Kitchener<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">&#8216;Backlash&#8217; against rising transit costs feared by Cambridge mayor<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.therecord.com\/opinion\/letters\/article\/485543--learn-from-others\" target=\"_blank\">The Record: February 16, 2011<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   Let me share a vision. A region approaching 500,000 residents chooses to invest in rapid transit. Too small for separated rail, they compare light rail and buses in separated lanes or roads, finding rail superior. After electoral turnover, they crunch numbers again and still find rail is the best tool for the present, with cheaper costs and better development opportunities for the future.<br \/>   <br \/>   Rapid buses mirror future rail lines to develop ridership and use predictions. Opposition to development by parts of the region forces development there to be postponed, but rail comes. Spending is split between roads and transit, parking becomes rarer and costlier, transit thrives. Suburban feeder bus routes provide over half of LRT boardings, with rail beating buses for passenger cost, injury, and collision rates (82%, 42%, and 85% lower).<br \/>   <br \/>   Core employment and transit ridership grow, but avoiding land acquisition proved costlier than not, poor land use decisions having long lasting consequences. Council learns, plans better, with multiple rail lines a core community shaper.<br \/>   <br \/>   That vision actually started when just 470,000 called Calgary home in 1968, retold in the city report \"Light Rail Transit in Calgary The First 25 Years.\" Let's not waste those lessons.<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/member.php\/731-ViewFromThe42\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Dodds<\/a><br \/>   Waterloo<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Just the facts, please<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Re: &#8220;Transit proposes to add 57 employees, 19 buses&#8221; and &#8220;&#8216;Backlash&#8217; against rising transit costs feared by Cambridge mayor&#8221;<br \/>   <br \/>   Two transit-related articles by Jeff Outhit appeared this week. The first, while largely factual, reports the proposed improvements to transit and its associated costs in a negative fashion, drawing attention immediately to &#8220;non-stop tax and fare increases,&#8221; and claiming &#8220;public outcry against trains.&#8221; The second seems somewhat of a non-story - Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig, a known opponent of the region's transit plans, fears 'backlash' against increasing transit costs. Since no evidence is presented that the people of this region are vocalizing backlash, one has to wonder if the article itself is an attempt to manufacture this predicted outrage.<br \/>   <br \/>   Mr. Outhit's opposition to improving transit and rapid transit in this region is well known through his opinion columns. I don't object to him voicing his opinions there, even though I disagree with him strongly. Through studying the facts, I have come to the conclusion that investing in transit infrastructure and LRT is critical and the best use of our money for transportation. The problem I have is that Mr. Outhit appears to also colour his reporting of news with his opinions. I would ask that if Mr. Outhit cannot keep his opinions to himself when he has his reporter hat on, that he leave it up to others to give us the facts on transit issues.<br \/>   <br \/>   Mike Boos<br \/>   Kitchener<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">LRT Motion this evening<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Dear Regional Councillors,<br \/>   <br \/>   Congratulations to all on your recent election victories. Well deserved in all cases. <br \/>   <br \/>   I am writing today to encourage you to defeat the motion put forward by Mayor Craig to reopen BRT options for transit. I am more than aware that the shortfalls in funding may require substantial investments on the part of the region, or even a re-development of the existing plans, but this cannot put an end to LRT. To move away from LRT would be a short term fix that is likely to cost more in the long term.<br \/>   <br \/>   To those who question whether or not LRT will \"cause\" people to move from cars to transit - the writing is already on the wall. The intensification in uptown Waterloo, the new office developments in downtown Kitchener show that a new breed of homeowner\/worker (often used to transit in Toronto) is moving to our region. <br \/>   <br \/>   I also encourage you to change the tone of the debate. Remind the public that this isn't just about an LRT \"running from mall to mall\", but rather a complete redevelopment of the transit system, with new direct and express buses from all the suburban areas to allow all community members to have a viable transit option.<br \/>   <br \/>   As a region, we have an obligation to think about our community 20, and even 50 years down the road.

I suggested a theoretical $450 million system; would the $300 million remain and with the one third ($150 million) federal funding put zero per cent of the costs on regional shoulders? Could a $300 million system result in a surplus federal\/provincial contribution of $100 million to put towards operational costs?<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We have committed $300 million for Waterloo Region's rapid transit corridor. Our funding commitment will not change based on the decision that the Region makes about what rapid transit plan will best serve their residents,\" from Kelly Baker, Communications Advisor for the Office of the Minister of Transportation, was the answer I received.<br \/>   <br \/>   Why pay $230 million or so when we can pay $90 million for a BRT solution? Or pay nothing for an even cheaper system? Or even get money to run any system under $450 million? Money for nothing and get your rides for free? I am a proponent of LRT, having lived and commuted in Ottawa (with BRT), Toronto (Subway\/LRT), Waterloo (iXpress), and Mississauga (none), up to two and a half hours for a workday commute. I feel I understand that we have the province pushing 10,000 new bodies into our Region each year. I feel I would rather attract those 10,000 with efficient transit systems that have seen condos and development rise around even Toronto's least used subway lines, rather than promote the sprawl of Ottawa or Mississauga, far more costly in the long run, by succumbing to sticker shock, and having the province instead feed us 10,000 people a year who had no motivation to come here on their own.<br \/>   <br \/>   It's a hard sell that's now harder when you only look at the dollar signs. I hope that council can start making a better case - showing the 84 new lanes of road that a poor system wouldwould require to eat into heritage buildings and citizen's homes, showing the benefits of an LRT system that lasts 40 years by costing things beyond year 17, showing the labour savings of employing one LRT driver for every 4.6 buses that would need drivers and engines that would need mechanics as the system grew - and help me feel that I haven't sought to settle here in vain.<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/member.php\/731-ViewFromThe42\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Dodds<\/a><br \/>   Waterloo<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">A response to recent developments<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Dear Councillor Reid,<br \/>   <br \/>   As a resident of Ward 1, I feel I must add my voice to the discussions currently taking place within this city about two significant infrastructure projects. You have no doubt heard from a number of residents regarding these initiatives; however, judging from the reception they received in the local media, I would wager that few in Cambridge have said what I am about to say.<br \/>   <br \/>   Regarding the contentious light rail project, please know that it has my full support. While the initial costs are certainly staggering, the long-term benefits--both environmental and economical--far outweigh them. I am dismayed that Cambridge will not receive light rail service from Day 1, instead receiving rapid buses until usage increases. However, as long as the criteria for receiving light rail service in Cambridge is made clear from the outset, I will be content with buses in the interim. Any move to alleviate congestion and improve transit between our cities can only benefit the city and encourage more rapid expansion of light rail into Cambridge.<br \/>   <br \/>   Please know that I do not agree with Mayor Craig's anti-light rail position, and believe that taking such a position will prove damaging in the long run. At a time when we should be cooperating with the other cities and townships in Waterloo Region for sustainable economic growth, Mayor Craig is widening the divide between Cambridge and KW. I will always be in favour of an independent Cambridge within Waterloo Region, but I fear that asserting independence at the cost of cooperation on mutually beneficial projects will not have the effect Mayor Craig hopes for. I have already heard many people in Kitchener and Waterloo use Mayor Craig's antagonistic position as justification for amalgamation of all three cities, and I doubt they are alone.<br \/>   <br \/>   The longer Regional Council hesitates to act on the light rail proposal, the more expensive it will become, and not only because of inflation. Several other municipalities in southern Ontario are exploring light rail projects; if we act now in tandem with cities such as Hamilton and Mississauga, there is a possibility that contracts for construction work and rolling stock for all new light rail lines can be shared, potentially reducing expenses. If we build alone, no such opportunity to build more economically will exist, unnecessarily increasing the cost to the taxpayer. We only have once chance to create a transit network that will serve Waterloo Region in the future; we need to get it right.<br \/>   <br \/>   Another project affecting Cambridge taxpayers is the proposed Cambridge Performing Arts Centre. I am also fully supportive of this venture, and of the partnership with Drayton Entertainment. While the facility will be located in Galt, the effects of the new theatre will be felt throughout Cambridge. Employment directly with the theatre and the hospitality businesses it serves is only one positive result. Success in one part of the city will encourage others to take a chance with Preston, Hespeler, Blair, and other neighbourhoods of Cambridge, repeating the story elsewhere within our borders. There is always a degree of financial risk when supporting the arts, but the city is minimizing this risk by partnering with a proven organization that contributes twenty years of success and growth. When the potential for revenue is taken into consideration, the contribution from the city is thoroughly justified.<br \/>   <br \/>   I do, however, share CEO Alex Mustakas' concerns about the proposed name for the Performing Arts Centre; further effort must be made to differentiate this venture from the similarly named Cambridge Arts Theatre and Cambridge Centre for the Arts across the river from the new theatre. All three are vital components in the rejuvenation of the core and must have strong, unique branding in order to thrive.<br \/>   <br \/>   In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your time and for taking my words into consideration.<br \/>   <br \/>   Sincerely,<br \/>   <br \/>   David J Haisell<br \/>   Cambridge","signature":"","date":"","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":false},"26597":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Bus Jam!<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Ever seen a bus jam? Many BRT systems have! Imagine Uptown with 10 buses trapped between lights all trying to stop at the uptown bus stop. This is something that is already happening with the current Route 7 and iXpress routes. With the implementation of a BRT system this can only get worse. Over the next couple years Route 7 and the iXpress will need to have increased service to simply meet the demand and not leave people behind. <br \/>   <br \/>   With a BRT system I can only see a large increase in the amount of buses running this main line, with the unfortunate side effect of too many buses on the road. Currently the Route 7 buses are experiencing a 'bunching' problem. Bunching is where a bus leaves a little late or hits one too many lights. This first bus falls behind a little, but as a result of this it has to pick more people up, and stop are more stops for longer. Eventually this first bus will slow down so much that it will meet up with the bus behind it. While the bus behind it is experiencing a particularly quick ride this is because it doesn't need to stop at as many stops as the slower bus infront has picked them up already. Bunching is a very annoying problem. As is slows down both buses, and causes huge gaps in service.

Since the region took over, ridership in Cambridge has continuously improved, but still has a long way<br \/>   to go.<br \/>   <br \/>   Originally intended as a significant transit upgrade for Kitchener and Waterloo&#8217;s now-overcrowded central transit corridor, the rapid transit study was expanded to see if Cambridge&#8217;s inclusion was justifiable. Over five years later, we now have ten options which all include Cambridge: one light rail transit, one bus rapid transit, and eight mixes of both. Instead of appreciation for Cambridge&#8217;s inclusion in rapid transit, however, Mayor Craig is now throwing a fit, attacking regional staff, and talking out of both sides of his mouth.<br \/>   <br \/>   He blasts LRT, insisting that it&#8217;s too expensive and that rapid buses are a superior choice. But now that the cheapest option is one that still includes LRT for K-W, suddenly buses aren&#8217;t as good as trains! He now also complains that buses won&#8217;t generate the same economic development. He supports &#8220;superior&#8221; buses, while at the same time complaining that K-W is getting a better system!<br \/>   <br \/>   With his self-contradictory statements, it&#8217;s clear what Mayor Craig&#8217;s real position is. With a ridership level still one-fourth of K-W&#8217;s, doubling the LRT price tag to include Cambridge is not realistic. So now in the interest of &#8220;fairness&#8221;, he proposes K-W settle with an inadequate bus system which will be over capacity in less than two decades, requiring a disruptive multi-billion dollar conversion to LRT.<br \/>   <br \/>   Cambridge leaders have failed at transit and now Mayor Craig plans to waste our money and hold K-W back.

The affordability of the personal auto. The car has been affordable because of the low price of energy (Petro and Hyrdo) hence manufacturing a car and fueling a car was extremely cheap. Now we can see the average price of buying and maintaining a car rising over the next 20 years the affordability of a car will out grow the lower-middle class.

The higher cost of the personal car will move people to the much more affordable public transportation system. The electric car will not be affordable for the same reasons.<br \/>    <br \/>    2. Traffic Jams and the commute. With the social stigma that you have to drive to work traffic jams will worsen. As people see the rapid transit just zoom by the traffic jams people will start to move to the rapid transit system.<br \/>    <br \/>    3. Parking. Parking will become more and more difficult and more and more expensive. With an effective rapid transit plan the cities will have to implement paid parking. And because eventually parking will take upwards of 5 minutes to find a spot and cost about the same as a ticket on the new rapid transit system people will find it much more convenient to take rapid transit than to have to deal with their car.<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/member.php\/620-bzmwillemsen\" target=\"_blank\">Brett Willemsen<\/a><br \/>    Kitchener<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Transportation Shouldn't Be A Political Issue<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    As The Region continues to host sessions designed to better inform the residents of Cambridge, Kitchener and Waterloo about their options for the construction of a future rapid transit system, an alternative consensus appears to be emerging, one diametrically opposed to the assumption that rapid buses (BRT) for all three cities is the best option.  This new alternative states that full light rail transit (LRT) should be implemented across the entire region in the first phase of construction, rather than building trains in Kitchener and Waterloo first, and in Cambridge in a second phase of the project.  In a recent article by The Record's Terry Pender, \"Many at Cambridge transit session favour light rail,\" Cambridge resident Stanley Pommer was quoted as saying: \"I think [full light rail from Waterloo to Cambridge] is the way to go.\"  Pommer, 84, likes the fact that light rail would not be as adversely affected by increasing gas prices as buses, pointing to Calgary as a example of the right way to implement an LRT system.  <br \/>    <br \/>    While it is true that Calgary is often considered to boast North America's best (and most well-used) LRT system, it is interesting that Alberta's largest city is now being evoked as an example of the right way to implement good rapid transit by detractors of the Region's preferred LRT\/BRT hybrid options.  Missing from the assertion that our own region should take a more Calgary-like approach to rapid transit by building full LRT now is the recognition that in Calgary's case, light rail has experienced a slow, deliberate process of implementation, which began first in its most dense and urban areas, but which has since methodically expanded over time to incorporate more and more of the city (and its suburbs) as ridership and transit orientation continued to develop beyond its central core. (Calgary has recently passed a new 30 year transit development plan, demonstrating their clear understanding that transportation is not a political issue, but rather a matter of strong vision and good common sense.) The fact that our own Regional Council has made the initial construction of BRT in Cambridge a priority from the outset (often lost is the fact that Cambridge will receive rapid service well before either Kitchener or Waterloo according to the currently planned implementation process) is a reflection of the Region's commitment to extending full LRT to Cambridge, when the level of service provided by light rail is warranted, as is currently the case between Uptown Waterloo and Downtown Kitchener, and potentially further north and south along the proposed line as well. <br \/>    <br \/>    If we are truly serious about our desire to follow the good example that Calgary offers, we will implement the technology which is best-suited to each individual area within our own region, we will continue to build ridership along corridors which we have identified as keys to future transit oriented growth, and we will remain firmly committed to a long term approach to efficiently and effectively move this region away from car-dependent, gridlock-destined patterns toward more sustainable, cost-effective transportation solutions.  Many of the currently proposed LRT\/BRT hybrid options for a regional rapid transit system clearly follow this pragmatic (and Calgary inspired) model for transportation and growth management.<br \/>    <br \/>    Branden Wesseling<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Generational Divide Is Exactly Why We Should Build LRT<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    A common theme in the LRT debate is that many students and young professionals support it, while many from the older generation are opposed. I believe this generational divide provides a compelling reason to invest in LRT now. The transportation networks we build and maintain today are going to leave an impression for the next 50-100 years, not just the next 15. We need the foresight to build something that can be used not only by this emerging generation, but by their children as well.<br \/>    <br \/>    Today's young adults are more likely to have a cellphone than a driver's license. This presents us with a unique opportunity to invest in a rapid transit system that will enable these young professionals to choose lifestyles that do not require a personal vehicle.

This decision will shape how our communities grow for decades.  Experts agree that rail will foster quality urban growth, attract greater ridership, and provide stronger long-term solutions to increasing congestion, rising gas prices, and diminishing reserves of land on which to build new houses, offices and shops.  Rapid buses will do less to shape our urban areas, but come with a smaller initial price tag.  On the surface, this decision is about money.  Can we afford light rail, and will enough people use it to justify the additional cost that accompanies the best option under review.  However, there is something far greater at stake than the $700 total 10-year cost - the price of a single tank of gas per year - to each regional household that light rail will bring.  Our collective psyche is under interrogation, and the results of our rapid transit debate will go a long way to determining how we feel about who we are and where we are going.  Beyond that, our rapid transit debate will go a long way to providing future generations with a framework for how to value this region, and how to understand their place within it.<br \/>   <br \/>   The real question then becomes, do we value ourselves enough to make the kind of practical, necessary long-term investment in our collective future that light rail represents?  Or are we no longer capable of anything but the worst kind of cynicism, even when we evaluate our own worth?  Bus rapid transit is a declaration of our self-defeating uncertainty of our own meaningful future.  Light rail is a declaration that this region can be great, that our future is worth caring about, and that we have a big responsibility to build a better and stronger Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   Branden Wesseling","signature":"","date":"","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":false},"30112":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Take A Leadership Role <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Dear Counselor,<br \/>    <br \/>    I would like to ask you to take a leadership role for our region and approve Light Rail this June. With all due respect to those requesting a referendum, federal and provincial funds won't stay on the table indefinitely, and they aren't indexed to inflation, so every month of delay means our local share of costs goes up.  I want to see the Region acting with a vision for the future. I have seen a lot of politicians passing the buck on leadership regarding rapid transit.<br \/>    <br \/>    I believe the LRT system proposed for our Region promotes a vision of a place I will want to live in twenty years. LRT, more so than other options, will attract exciting new industry, culture, and people to the Region, and we can accomplish this growth without giving up the beautiful country\/urban mix we currently enjoy.<br \/>    <br \/>    I am curious how many LRT skeptics have themselves ridden light rail of the type under proposal. Electric light rail is smoother and more comfortable than a bus. It's faster than streetcars mixed in traffic, quieter than heavier trains and subways, and it compares favourably in every possible way against sitting in a car in a traffic jam.<br \/>    <br \/>    BRT makes an OK second choice, but a short-sighted choice for the long term. My understanding is that the only Canadian bus rapid transit system which has been operating for a decade (Ottawa BRT), is now planned to be replaced with a Light Rail system, at great cost and disruption to their saturated traffic network.<br \/>    <br \/>    My experience is that LRT positively changes how you can get around in a city, particularly as a visitor, but also as a resident.  I recently spent a week touring Germany, and their integrated train systems are amazing. I have told many friends about my adventures exploring Kassel, Germany by light rail, including a beautiful trip through snow-covered woods which reminded me of Waterloo Park. I lived in Boston for a year, and when I could take the Green Line (LRT), I would always rather do so than drive, take a cab, or take the bus.  I've found cities with light rail easier to navigate than cities relying on bus transit- particularly cities that don't follow a grid (such as ours), where you can orient yourself by where the train goes.  Businesses make an effort to direct you from the nearest train stop; as a tourist, it's easier to hop on and off a frequent train, versus most of the city buses I've taken. Taking the train is a qualitatively different experience than getting around by a bus in traffic.<br \/>    <br \/>    I invite you to take a look at our Region with visitor's eyes; perhaps directing a business traveler from a hotel near Connestoga Mall to Bauer Kitchen. When they get home, will they speak favourably of driving on King and Weber Streets?  What if instead their trip were a hop on a train, through our wonderful Waterloo Park, over Silver Lake and into uptown?  They would look forward to returning!<br \/>    <br \/>    We're as large as Calgary and Edmonton were when they started their successful light rail systems. In ten years, we could be an urban\/rural gem where new tech startups flourish in a walkable, creative mix; where Google engineers return to Mountainview telling their friends about adventures at Oktoberfest, our urban parklands, and our world-class symphony; and where our smart, managed growth translates into plaudits and possibly additional funding from Queens Park and Ottawa for the next phase of rail expansion.<br \/>    <br \/>    Thank you for your time,<br \/>    <br \/>    Daniel Allen<br \/>    Kitchener","signature":"","date":"","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":false},"30270":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Outhit's Article On Campaign Promises<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   Received May 31, 2011<br \/>   <br \/>   To whom it may concern,<br \/>   <br \/>   As a daily reader of The Record, I am writing in regard to Jeff Outhit's front-page article \"Anti-Rail Group Fears Broken Election Promises\" from today's edition.

Although Outhit had this information, it is nowhere in the article.<br \/>   <br \/>   Nor does the article include any information on what, exactly, was promised by any of the other seven councilors who Mr. Outhit (behind the shield of Ruth Haworth) accuses of impending betrayal of voter's trust.<br \/>   <br \/>   In a news article purportedly about campaign promises, these are glaring omissions.<br \/>   <br \/>   Glaring, too, is the choice to compare prices in 2009 dollars to those in 2014 dollars, without conversion to a common currency, making the latter number appear artificially inflated. Facts about the decrease in cost are consistently framed in the article by \"he said,\" in an attempt to cast these figures as the opinion of an advocate - even though they are published in a Region of Waterloo report that was provided to Mr. Outhit (the exchange is published here: <a href=\"\/web\/20120403031108\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=219&amp;p=30121#post30121\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/sho...0121#post30121<\/a>).<br \/>   <br \/>   It is clear from these choices that Mr. Outhit did not write the article to inform, but rather to inspire fear and outrage.<br \/>   <br \/>   This is one more example of biased reporting in Jeff Outhit's long-running campaign to use The Record as a soapbox for his own political views on transit.

The word marijuana comes from the Mexican Spanish word, marihuana. According to the United Nations, cannabis \"is the most widely used illicit substance in the world.\"<br \/>   The major psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis is &#916;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (commonly abbreviated as THC). Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, including at least 66 other cannabinoids (cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), etc.) which can result in different effects from those of THC alone.<br \/>   Cannabis use has been found to have occurred as long ago as the 3rd millennium BC In modern times, the drug has been used for recreational, religious or spiritual, and medicinal purposes. The UN estimated that in 2004 about 4% of the world's adult population (162 million people) use cannabis annually, and about 0.6% (22.5 million) use it on a daily basis. The possession, use, or sale of cannabis preparations containing psychoactive cannabinoids became illegal in most parts of the world in the early 20th century.    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>     <a href=\"\/web\/20110404075333\/http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/documentaries\/doczone\/2010\/cannabiz\/factsheet.html\" target=\"_blank\">CBC Fact Sheet: Marijuana in Canada<\/a><br \/>   <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<b>Industry<\/b><br \/>   Marijuana is estimated to be a $19-21 billion dollar industry in Canada.

Executive Summary:<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The Applicant is proposing to amend the City\u2019s 1990 Official Plan by adding a new Special Policy Area to the subject lands to permit an increase in density from 250 units\/ha to 356 units\/ha. The Applicant is also proposing to amend the City\u2019s Zoning Bylaw 1108 by rezoning the subject lands from Industrial \u2013 25 (I-25) to Multiple Residence \u2013 25 (MR-25) with site specific provisions, including a reduction in parking and an increase in density. The application is being advanced to permit the development of multiple apartment buildings, varying in height from 6 to 25 storeys. Two of the buildings, one facing Phillip St and one facing Columbia St, would contain commercial uses.<br \/>    <br \/>    The applicant has requested consideration of the City\u2019s density bonusing policies (in Section 12.3.1 of 2012 Official Plan), which allow Council to consider, in its sole discretion, an increase in density, in exchange for community benefits. It is important to note that while the 2012 Official Plan contemplates density bonusing, it does not suggest that all applications should be eligible. An applicant can request the use of density bonusing, but the City must agree, as the implementation requires an agreement between the City and the owner. Ultimately, the decision lies with Council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Based on Development Services review of the application, we support OPA 85 and Z-12-05 in accordance with Section 7 of DS2013-004, for the following reasons:<br \/>    <ul><li style=\"\"> the application is consistent with the 2005 Provincial Policy Statement, and conforms to the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe;<\/li><li style=\"\"> the application conforms to the Regional Official Policies Plan (ROPP);<\/li><li style=\"\"> the application meets the intent of the City of Waterloo Official Plan (1990) and conforms to the (Adopted) 2012 Official Plan (prior to the Northdale modification);<\/li><li style=\"\"> the application is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Northdale Land Use Study;<\/li><li style=\"\"> the proposal includes a mix of uses in close proximity to employment areas and the University of Waterloo;<\/li><li style=\"\"> the development represents Transit Oriented Design, by providing mixed used, pedestrian scale development that is inviting with a high level of urban design;<\/li><li style=\"\"> the development, through the use of density bonusing, includes LEED Silver design on multiple buildings, which will set a standard by which other high density developments can be measured and which responds to the global challenge of climate change;<\/li><li style=\"\"> the development includes a substantial amount of underground parking, thereby making effective use of the land; and<\/li><li style=\"\"> the development includes rooftop amenity space, at mid-level height, providing future residents of the buildings with outdoor amenity space.<\/li><\/ul><b>B. Financial Implications:<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Staff is not aware of any municipal financial implications with respect to the requested application.

Legal Considerations<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    Staff consulted with the City\u2019s Solicitor regarding the best manner in which to implement the necessary approvals (Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendments) in light of the ongoing appeals to the Northdale Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment. The City Solicitor\u2019s advice and input has been incorporated into this report and is reflected in Section 7 \u2013 Recommendations.<br \/>    <br \/>    Should Council support the application, a by-law must be passed to adopt the Official Plan Amendment and to implement the zone change as approved. Should Council deny the application, the applicant may appeal Council\u2019s decision to the Ontario Municipal Board. Conversely, if Council approves the application, any other party may appeal the decision to the Ontario Municipal Board.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>E.

Other Considerations<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    <u>Economic Vitality<\/u><br \/>    Although not a land use planning consideration, the proposal supports the City\u2019s economic vitality by:<br \/>    <ul><li style=\"\"> Providing construction employment;<\/li><li style=\"\"> Paying City Development Charges;<\/li><li style=\"\"> Increasing the assessed value of the lands;<\/li><li style=\"\"> Providing cash-in-lieu of parkland which can be used to provide parkland within the Northdale neighbourhood<\/li><\/ul>...<br \/>    <br \/>    The revised proposal includes four apartment buildings, ranging in height from 6 storeys to 25 storeys. The building with a podium facing Phillip St would contain main floor commercial uses on the portion closest to Phillip St and the building facing Columbia St would also contain main floor commercial uses. Both of the 25 storey buildings would have 6 storey podiums and roof top amenity areas. Combined, the four buildings would contain a total of 1420 bedrooms. All units would contain 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms. A copy of the concept site plan is included in Appendix \u2018C\u2019.<br \/>    <br \/>    The revised proposal meets the intent of the Northdale Land Use Study in the following ways:<br \/>    <ul><li style=\"\"> Including multiple buildings that address both the Phillip St and Columbia St frontages;<\/li><li style=\"\"> Through the inclusion of commercial uses in two different buildings, one that faces Phillip St and one that faces Columbia St;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The use of podiums for the two towers along Phillip St, with each podium 6 storeys in height and with step backs between the podium and tower;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The streetscape along Phillip St, with the inclusion of the podiums, is now pedestrian scale, enabling the outdoor areas in front of the building to be more effectively utilized and more attractive to users of the site;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The Columbia St streetscape has now been addressed, with a 6-storey mixed use building facing the street;<\/li><li style=\"\"> A significant amount of the supplied parking is located underground, allowing for a better distribution of the buildings\/units on site as well as the location of the podiums;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The podiums have rooftop, outdoor amenity space devoted to the future residents of the buildings;<\/li><li style=\"\"> Improved pedestrian scale development on Phillip St with more useable and pedestrian friendly amenity space. This space has great potential to support the commercial uses with patio space;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The proposal complies with the by-law requirement for landscape open space at grade; and<\/li><li style=\"\"> The amount of parking provided is based on the Northdale Mixed Use (NMU) Zone requirements.<\/li><\/ul>The concept building elevation is included on the following page and a copy of the elevation and site plan are included as an Appendix to this report.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Parking<\/b><br \/>    <br \/>    The applicant has requested a reduction in the required amount of parking. An analysis of the required and requested parking is included in the table on the following page.<br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109221814im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Developments\/Waterloo\/University%20Zone\/300%20Phillip%20Street\/300%20Phillip%20Street%20-%20Parking.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    As noted in the table, the applicant is proposing 439 spaces, which is 162 less than the MR-25 zone requires. However, the proposed parking would comply with the requirements of the NMU zone, which will apply to the majority of the Northdale neighbourhood, including several abutting properties. In support of the request, the applicant has submitted a parking review, which examined how many spaces were occupied at different times of the day for two different apartment buildings, both geared to students. The applicant\u2019s analysis indicates that a ratio of 1 parking space for every 4 beds is sufficient to meet the demand. The applicant is providing 84 parking spaces to support the commercial uses on the site. Staff is of the opinion that demand for the commercial parking spaces may be lowered due to:<br \/>    <ul><li style=\"\"> The proximity of those living in the apartment buildings on site;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The significant amount of employees within walking distance, on Phillip St\/Columbia St (e.g. Blackberry) and at the University of Waterloo;<\/li><li style=\"\"> The significant amount of students either at the University of Waterloo on the opposite side of Phillip St, as well as the many students that walk past the site on their way to and from the University;<\/li><\/ul>The zoning by-law requires a gross amount of parking on the site; it does not dictate how the spaces are to be used. As such, there may be potential in the future for the applicant to devote some of the unused commercial spaces to tenants\/owners of the residential units.<br \/>    <br \/>    The NMU zone and the Northdale OPA were specifically designed to reduce the requirement for parking and encourage alternative forms of transportation. The subject lands could not be better situated to reduce the demand for automobile use. The proximity of the University of Waterloo, Blackberry and other employers along Phillip St and the LRT station on the UW campus all will serve to reduce the need to have and use an automobile.<br \/>    <br \/>    Given that the applicant, with staff encouragement, has approached the design of their site with the Northdale policies and NMU zone as reference, staff can support the reduction in parking.<br \/>    <br \/>    ...<br \/>    <br \/>    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">Location Map<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109221814im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Developments\/Waterloo\/University%20Zone\/300%20Phillip%20Street\/300%20Phillip%20Street%20-%20Location%20Map.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    Site Plan<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109221814im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Developments\/Waterloo\/University%20Zone\/300%20Phillip%20Street\/300%20Phillip%20Street%20-%20Site%20Plan.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    Renderings<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109221814im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Developments\/Waterloo\/University%20Zone\/300%20Phillip%20Street\/300%20Phillip%20Street%20-%20Rendering%20-%201.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109221814im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/wdrive\/Developments\/Waterloo\/University%20Zone\/300%20Phillip%20Street\/300%20Phillip%20Street%20-%20Rendering%20-%202.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>","signature":"","date":"03-04-2013 07:43 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"42738":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Dec 2011","num_posts":"252"}},"content":"1, 2 and 3 bedroom units.

If one assumes our contributions to the Toronto Stock Exchange are equal to the Canadian average then our citizens have $32-billion invested.  Yet our local corporations are only worth $7-billion.  Where's the other $25-billion?  It's being used to fund Toronto's banks, retail, media &amp; telecom sectors and Calgary's oil &amp; gas industry. <br \/>   <br \/>   Those outside companies might be fine investment opportunities, but they don't create job opportunities in this region, at least not to the same extent that locally based corporations would. <br \/>   <br \/>   Not only does Waterloo Region's corporate community lack size, it also lacks diversity.  Over 99% of our local market cap is based in the technology industry (<a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=BRB\" target=\"_blank\">Brick Brewing<\/a> is the single exception). Don't get me wrong, it's great to have such a vibrant tech community here. That said, nobody should invest 99% of their RRSP in any one sector. The lack of diversity is forcing locals to invest elsewhere. Waterloo Region needs listed companies like <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=SC\" target=\"_blank\">Shoppers Drug Mart<\/a>, <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=CTC.A\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Tire<\/a>, <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=RCI.B\" target=\"_blank\">Rogers<\/a>, <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=pza.un\" target=\"_blank\">Pizza Pizza<\/a>, <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=THI\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Hortons<\/a>,  <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/tmx.quotemedia.com\/quote.php?qm_symbol=td\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto-Dominion Bank<\/a>, etc..<br \/>   <br \/>   Speaking of the banking sector, imagine the benefit to our community if we could pull out our estimated $4.5-billion invested with the Big Six, to create the Bank of Kitchener.

Perhaps if Schneiders hadn't been bought by Maple Leaf Foods they'd have announced they're opening a new plant on the former Budd site, rather than moving to Hamilton.<br \/>   <br \/>   We also have a retail issue in all of our cores.  The City of Kitchener has invested $100-million downtown, there's been significant residential &amp; office construction, and the Region is getting ready to build LRT; yet Fairview Park Mall got a $30-million renovation, and tens of millions are being spent for retail on Ira Needles Blvd. The City of Kitchener has been begging for years to get a grocery store downtown, but Loblaws and Sobeys don't care. I'd love the Region to put at least 50,000 sq ft of retail in the new Transit Hub, but I can't recommend that with 100% confidence while the commercial space at the Kitchener Market &amp; Charles\/Benton Garage sits underused (although I've heard good news is coming for the latter soon).<br \/>   <br \/>   If we want a grocery store in Downtown Kitchener we're going to have to build it ourselves. If we want Downtown Kitchener to regain it's role as the major retail hub in the City of Kitchener, then we're going to have to rebuild that hub ourselves.<br \/>   <br \/>   My proposal to create a community corporation is to help solve those problems. That's what they've done in <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/11\/13\/business\/a-town-in-new-york-creates-its-own-department-store.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">Saranac Lake<\/a>. Instead of having Wal-Mart suck profits out of their community, 600 citizens got together and opened their own business. <br \/>   <br \/>   Why isn't there one in Toronto?  The country's biggest city already benefits economically from being the headquarters of 100's of companies.  From a community building standpoint, there's no question that Downtown Toronto is the dominant retail hub of the GTA.  There isn't a need for a Toronto fund with a dual mandate to create wealth &amp; contribute to the city the same way there is in Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   In order for a community corporation to get off the ground it needs a lot of active investors.  People who are going to help build it, shop there and promote it.  Where do you find them?  It's the same people who care deeply about their community.  They go to rapid transit meetings, they present at council, they attend Northdale open houses, they volunteer with the Cambridge Fall Fair &amp; Elmira Maple Syrup Festival, etc..<br \/>   <br \/>   Speaking personally, my great-great-great grandfather's home is a <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.city.waterloo.on.ca\/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=928\" target=\"_blank\">designated heritage property<\/a>, and two of <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.city.waterloo.on.ca\/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=802\" target=\"_blank\">my<\/a> <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.city.waterloo.on.ca\/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=801\" target=\"_blank\">relatives<\/a> have been mayors.  I have a lot of family history in the area and want the best for Waterloo Region. <br \/>   <br \/>   In addition to active investors, a community corporation also needs good business ideas. One of the first ideas a few people would like to see developed is a Board Games Cafe.  One opened in Toronto called <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.snakesandlattes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Snakes &amp; Lattes<\/a> in 2010.  It's been so popular they expanded last year and are doing <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/media\/set\/?set=a.473710645993830.117825.109653945732837&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\">renovations again this year<\/a>. They have two thousand board games which they charge you a $5 cover to play for as long as you want.  It provides a social alternative to a night out drinking.  I'd recommend checking them out next time you're in Toronto.  Snakes &amp; Lattes is located at <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/https:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?q=600+Bloor+St+W,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario+M6G+1K4&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=43.482218,-80.546719&amp;sspn=0.166406,0.330963&amp;t=h&amp;geocode=FZ1FmgIdTEBE-w&amp;hnear=600+Bloor+St+W,+Toronto,+Toronto+Division,+Ontario+M6G+1K4&amp;z=16\" target=\"_blank\">600 Bloor St West<\/a>, near the Bathurst Subway Station. <br \/>   <br \/>   Of course all businesses have risks, but with lots of students and a large math\/geek population in the area, a Board Games Cafe seems like a good fit.<br \/>   <br \/>   There's a half-dozen people interested so far, with $50,000 to invest. <br \/>   <br \/>   What we really could use are interested people who bring skills to the table: lawyer, accountant, realtor, construction worker, someone who's opened\/managed a cafe in the past.  These people also stand to benefit by collecting fees\/wages from the business.<br \/>   <br \/>   If this project sounds like something you'd like to help build then come out to the next meetings.

If you're interested in discussing &amp; being part of business development in Waterloo Region come out to the42.<br \/>   <br \/>   Here's another example to highlight the retail problem in our urban communities.  <br \/>   <br \/>   How many places would a male in his 20's buy a pair of jeans at in <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/kitchenerdowntown.com\/business-categories\/apparel\/\" target=\"_blank\">Downtown Kitchener<\/a>?  I count 1, Gloss. That's no better than 2006 when Eleventh Hour was where Shoppers Drug Mart currently exists.  No progress in 6 years. <br \/>   <br \/>   How many places would a male in his 20's buy a pair of jeans at in <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.fairviewpark.ca\/EN\/directory\/Pages\/StoresByCategory.aspx#58\" target=\"_blank\">Fairview Park Mall<\/a>? I count 16, Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Banana Republic, Bluenotes, Bootlegger, GUESS, Hollister, Jean Machine, Le Chateau, Mexx, RW &amp; Co., Sirens, The Gap, West 49, Sears, The Bay.<br \/>   <br \/>   1 versus 16, it's no contest. If a group of friends are looking to go shopping, they're likely to head to Fairview where there's a lot more selection. <br \/>   <br \/>   What percentage of retail sales do you think Downtown Kitchener receives compared to the Fairview district?  I don't have a statistic to point you to, but would you honestly say it's over 10%?  I wouldn't and that's just pathetic. <br \/>   <br \/>   My vision for Kitchener is to have <u>downtown as the main retail hub in the city<\/u>.  A goal should be to see retail sales downtown at least 150% of Fairview. In other words, we need to grow retail sales downtown by at least 15X to satisfy me that it's <i>the<\/i> place to shop at in Kitchener.  I can't emphasis enough just how big of a task this is. We don't need 1-2 new stores, we need 1-2 hundred new stores. <br \/>   <br \/>   It's great there's new shops opening downtown.  However some of them are just replacing other lost businesses, ie. the <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=123&amp;p=40278#post40278\" target=\"_blank\">Ontario Street Boutiques<\/a> used to be a Greek hub with the <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.downtownkitchener.ca\/dining\/catering\/\" target=\"_blank\">Acropolis Bakery<\/a>.  There used to be a furniture store at the Eaton Lofts. Some growth is happening, but it's nowhere close to being fast enough to meet the goal I've set out in my lifetime.  Together our community needs to change our current trajectory.<br \/>   <br \/>   We're about to enter the busiest shopping period of the year, the perfect time to do a direct comparison.  I'm sure there will be 100s of people lined up at Best Buy for Boxing Day Sales at 5am.  I'm sure there will be line-ups stretching outside stores at Faiview Mall.  None of this sales traffic will exist in Downtown Kitchener, where we'll be lucky to see a half-dozen people in line at any one time.  December 26th should break your heart as an urbanist in Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   I know I've just focused on Kitchener, but similar things could be said of UpTown Waterloo vs. Conestoga Mall &amp; the Galt\/Preston\/Hespeler cores vs. Cambridge Centre.<br \/>   <br \/>   We could look at building new businesses ourselves from scratch. We could look at setting up a local community version of <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/dragonsden\/\" target=\"_blank\">Dragon's Den<\/a> where we finance &amp; support other's ideas.  We have to do something though if we want our cores to be our main retail hubs again in the next 15-20 years.","signature":"","date":"11-13-2012 06:57 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"5"},"40548":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"591"}},"content":"Can't make it tonight but I hope to be able to come to future meetings.","signature":"","date":"11-14-2012 12:51 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"6"},"40553":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Oct 2010","num_posts":"954"}},"content":"Damn, you need to bump this thread with a bit more time to spare.

It's just easier to have a regular meeting spot rather than constant rotation while we look at setting this up. <br \/>   <br \/>   \"People will shop where the stores are.\" - exactly. One of the purposes of this fund is to open stores in our urban areas so people start shopping downtown again. <br \/>   <br \/>   If you agree that Kitchener's Fashion District should be in Downtown Kitchener rather than at Fairview Park Mall or The Boardwalk at Ira Needles then you belong here.<br \/>   <br \/>   Local independents struggle for a number of reasons. <br \/>   <br \/>   1) They don't have financing to expand\/innovate. McDonald's can easily get a $100-million loan for expansion while local mom &amp; pop stores don't have easy access to capital. Together we'll be community financing local projects rather than investing in companies that take money out of Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   2) They don't have the sales volume of large multinationals and therefore tend to charge higher prices. By building local chains we're hoping to be more competitive on pricing. For example I mentioned opening a Kitchener Denim store, but that doesn't have to start from scratch.  Instead we could approach Uptown's <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.denimbarwaterloo.ca\/index2.php?v=v1#\/home\/\" target=\"_blank\">Denim Bar<\/a> and expand them into Downtown Kitchener, Cambridge, Guelph &amp; further afield creating not only retail downtown but also office employment.<br \/>   <br \/>   3) They have to deal with personal &amp; location issues that are immaterial to larger corporations. When there was a fire at ish &amp; chips, that greatly affects their business plan.  It wouldn't affect McDonald's overall results or strategy if one of their locations was temporary closed due to a fire.  When a small business owner is going through a death in the family or a divorce, that affects their business. Few corporations are as dependent on a single person.<br \/>   <br \/>   It was asked how is this different than <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/goldentriangle.weebly.com\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Golden Triangle Angelnet<\/a>? A main difference is that I want WRIF to be accessible to everyone.  Reading Angelnet's <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/goldentriangle.weebly.com\/uploads\/4\/9\/0\/9\/4909265\/membership_package__2010-11b.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">membership package<\/a>, you'll see it's really for high net worth individuals (has a minimum of C$25,000 available for investment in early&#8208;stage companies on an annual basis).  There's  many industries where either the quantity of investors doesn't matter or there's a high-level of start-up risk that most people can't stomach.  If someone develops a blockbuster cancer drug there will be so much buzz that it will be an instant success. However our cores need as much love as they can get.  In turning Downtown Kitchener around, a single $5-million investment from Jim Balsillie, although welcome, would be less effective than 2500 people getting together and investing $2,000 each.  It's the \"community buzz\" factor that we need to fully revitalize Downtown Kitchener (and expand Uptown Waterloo, Downtown Galt, etc..).<br \/>   <br \/>   WRIF's financial returns are also likely to be lower than Angelnet. I'm proposing we start by going after proven industries that already exist in the suburbs or other cities.  We're not really inventing anything new and wouldn't need a large amount of unproven R&amp;D spending the same way a start-up tech\/biotech firm would.  We'd be going after 'boring' industries the same way Berkshire Hathaway invests in Coca-Cola.  Our goal would be a 5-8% return, no different than investing in an index fund. The extra benefit would be your personal satisfaction of contributing to making our cores and Waterloo Region a better place to live. Like any company, it could go bankrupt and you'd lose your investment. On the flip side, if the \"community buzz\" really gets loud WRIF could provide above average returns. We won't really know for sure until we test it out. <br \/>   <br \/>   I've been asked \"What is WRIF or what's your vision for this, I don't fully understand\"? I want WRIF to stand for \"Investing in Waterloo Region\".  The same way as buying <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/ca.ishares.com\/product_info\/fund\/holdings\/XIU.htm\" target=\"_blank\">XIU<\/a> shares (an exchange traded fund that replicates the performance of the S&amp;P\/TSX 60 Index) represent \"Investing in Canada\".  When you put $1000 into XIU, you're essentially putting $77 in the Royal Bank of Canada, $68 in TD Bank, $59 in Scotiabank, $47 in Suncor Energy, $35 in CN Rail, $32 in Barrack Gold, $30 in Potash Corp, $15 in Rogers, etc.  You're investing in the 60 biggest companies in the country.  XIU isn't really a company itself, it's just a basket that invests in other Canadian companies.<br \/>   <br \/>   So why then all this talk of creating businesses and Downtown Kitchener?  It's because Waterloo Region doesn't have 60 companies to invest in, we don't even have 10.  If Boeing had their HQ on Homer Watson Blvd, and Home Depot's HQ was on Franklin Drive, and Morgan Stanley was on Ontario Street, and Kraft Foods was on Northfield Drive, etc... it would be relatively easy to create a fund that invested a portion into each of our corps.  We don't have that luxury though, so not only do we need to create the basket, we also need to create the components to fill that basket.  That's where places like Downtown Kitchener come into play.  We're local, we're aware of the positive momentum happening downtown (Tannery, Breithaupt Block, 1 Victoria, LRT).  We know that it should be a good business opportunity over the next 5-10+ years.  Perhaps the fact that outside retailers aren't catching on is actually a blessing in disguise.  It gives us the chance to create our own local stores in the area where the profits stay in Waterloo Region.<br \/>   <br \/>   How is this proposal being marketed? For now we're using Wonderful Waterloo - a place where many of the initial investors\/volunteers would be found.  I've talked to councillors, developers, retailers, active residents, etc.. who all read WW.  It wouldn't make a lot of sense to promote \"building local\" and then using a San Francisco site like Twitter for discussion (that's why you don't see Facebook or Twitter logos on WW). We already have a large amount of local traffic on this site to promote the project:<br \/>   <br \/>   <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"\/web\/20131109225037im_\/http:\/\/wonderfulwaterloo.com\/advertising\/WWAnalyticsOctober27-November26,2012.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div><br \/>   So what are these meetings about? They're to gauge local interest in community investing. To see if we have 10-20-30 people to get this off the ground. They're informal where you can come out, have a beer, and chat about business opportunities you see in Waterloo Region.  There's no documents to be signed and no cheques to be written at this point. Everyone is welcome. If we have enough interest we can look at registering the corporation in 1Q2013.  Personally I'm interested in investing $10K to get this going.  My partner's also looking to put in $10K.  He's a PhD student studying computer science at UW, so he'll be able to help out with any tech skills we need (ie. building a website with table registration for a board games cafe). We're going to start off small with a 6-figure project, but there's no reason we can't build this into something much bigger. If we're able to generate the same level of community interest as in Saranac Lake (~$100 per capita) then we'd be looking at $50-million.  That type of figure isn't unheard of in this area.  The <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.grhosp.on.ca\/Balsillie\" target=\"_blank\">One Vision, One Voice Hospital Campaign<\/a> raised $44-million last decade, and that was for a donation where you gave up your money immediately as opposed to an investment where you have a chance to grow your wealth.  Let me clarify (before that's misinterpreted) we're not going after donation money though, we're going after investment dollars already in outside corporations.  The hospital example is just to illustrate that large sums of money are available in this region. <br \/>   <br \/>   One more frustrating personal note. Two friends, both Kitchener residents, are celebrating their birthday next month.  Where are they going? Toronto.  If you're tired of Waterloo Region being looked down upon as a place where \"special\" doesn't happen then WRIF is for you.","signature":"","date":"11-27-2012 02:24 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"12"},"41130":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"Town Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Apr 2010","num_posts":"363"}},"content":"Food for thought:<br \/>   <br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.theatlanticcities.com\/neighborhoods\/2012\/11\/real-estate-deal-could-change-future-everything\/3897\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.theatlanticcities.com\/nei...erything\/3897\/<\/a>","signature":"","date":"12-07-2012 03:23 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"13"},"41296":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109225037im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"The December 11th meeting went well.

For example, people could invest in a CIF as part of a Registered Retirement Savings Plan or as part of a venture capital initiative and receive a tax credit. A multi-stakeholder, independent board then evaluates applications and invests money from the local CIF to local environmentally responsible and socially innovative businesses, cooperatives, community enterprises, or affordable housing developments. The CIF in turn provides investors a specific withdrawal date and a guaranteed rate of return.&quot;   <br \/>   <br \/>   They have been successful in Nova Scotia: <br \/>   <br \/>   A relatively young CIF in Nova Scotia has already captured 2% of their region's RRSPs &#8211; in Greater Victoria, merely 2% of our RRSPs would redirect an astonishing $7.2 million into our local economy every single year. There is immense wealth in Greater Victoria, and we believe our region's citizens are amongst the most socially concerned and environmentally aware anywhere, so we're confident we could eventually capture double, triple, or perhaps an even a greater percentage. Imagine the impacts!<br \/>   <br \/>   In 2012, the Victoria CIF is asking &quot;the federal government to authorize the CIF as an RRSP-eligible fund, and we will ask the provincial government to provide its venture capital tax credit to CIF investors.&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   It appears, the CIF is a branch of a charity, rather than an independent entity on its own. But I don't see a reason why something like this can't evolve into something more independent. <br \/>   <br \/>   As for names, I like the Waterloo Regional Enterprise Network (WREN).","signature":"","date":"02-20-2013 01:23 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"17"},"44948":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109225037im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000FF\">Local Investing in Waterloo Region - Amy Cortese<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   The Waterloo Regional Enterprise Network Inc. would like to invite the community to attend a speaker event on June 25, 2013 from 5-7PM.

Amy Cortese, is a journalist and editor whose work has appeared in the New York Times, Mother Jones, Wired, and the Daily Beast. She is also the author of the book <i>Locavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How to Profit From it<\/i>, and has spoke to many communities across North America about the benefits of local investing. <br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Date:<\/b> Tuesday June 25th, 5:00-7:00pm<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Location:<\/b> Walper Hotel, 1 King St W, Kitchener, ON N2G 1A1 <br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Register:<\/b> <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/localinvestingwaterlooregion.eventbrite.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/localinvestingwaterlooregion.eventbrite.ca\/<\/a> <br \/>    <br \/>    This event will help generate awareness about important strategies that help facilitate local investing which benefits the community while also producing a return. Local investing has gained popularity in recent years as an alternative approach to investing that emphasizes tools such as crowd sourcing to shift capital away from large multinationals towards locally owned businesses. Most investors in the Waterloo Region contribute their savings to portfolios that contain equities from a range of high performing companies in the hopes of earning a return. These investments do little to benefit local business, which face significant obstacles to raising capital within the community to expand their enterprise. The event will help address these obstacles. <br \/>    <br \/>    The lecture is sponsored by the Waterloo Regional Enterprise Network (WREN) <a href=\"\/web\/20131109225037\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php?t=1434&amp;p=44948#post44948\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/sho...4948#post44948<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    For more information please contact, <br \/>    <br \/>    Jason Thistlethwaite PhD<br \/>    <br \/>    University of Waterloo<br \/>    <br \/>    519-807-0525<br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"mailto:jasonthistlethwaite@me.com\">jasonthistlethwaite@me.com<\/a>","signature":"","date":"06-24-2013 09:06 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"20"}}},"15":{"parent_forums":[{"forum_id":null,"forum_name":"Regional Economy and Politics"},{"forum_id":null,"forum_name":"Transportation and Infrastructure"}],"title":"Region of Waterloo International Airport | 106,321 Passengers (2009)","description":"Region of Waterloo International Airport (YKF)    1-4881 Fountain Street North, Breslau    www.waterlooairport.ca    Business Plan 2009-2014 (PDF)    NAV CANADA        http:\/\/waterlooairport.ca\/en\/images\/structure\/logo.jpg        Passenger Numbers","keywords":["airport","flying","ykf","makes","dramatically","telephone","airline","boarding","pushing","no-frills","printing","checking","summer","daily","http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/travel\/travelnews\/8944478\/ryanair-passengers-face-100-bag-charge.html","telegraph","waterloo","international","passengers","106,321","article","demands","ryanair","region","remain","online","unclear","check","increase","unchanged"],"canonical_url":null,"num_posts":"163","posts":{"44":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":false,"num_posts":""}},"content":"<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b><font size=\"5\"><font color=\"blue\">Region of Waterloo International Airport (YKF)<\/font><\/font><br \/>   1-4881 Fountain Street North, Breslau<br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064057\/http:\/\/www.waterlooairport.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.waterlooairport.ca<\/a><br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064057\/http:\/\/www.waterlooairport.ca\/en\/abouttheairport\/resources\/Airport%20Business%20Plan%202009.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Business Plan 2009-2014 (PDF)<\/a><br \/>   <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064057\/http:\/\/www.navcanada.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">NAV CANADA<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   <img src=\"\/web\/20120220064057im_\/http:\/\/waterlooairport.ca\/en\/images\/structure\/logo.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font color=\"blue\">Passenger Numbers<\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   <table class=\"stg_table tborder\" style=\"width:500px;

This announcement builds on the projects we have announced across the region, including needed new buildings at our post-secondary institutions, and road and bridge renewal.  The common element is that these projects were identified by our local partners as their priorities.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    \"Under the strong leadership of Premier Dalton McGuinty, Ontario is making historical infrastructure investments across the province and we have been since 2003,\" said Leeanna Pendergast, MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga. \"Investing in this project will create jobs now and help stimulate our local economy. Over the longer term we are also working hard to create a competitive advantage that attracts business and strengthens Ontario's economy.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    Regional Chair Ken Seilling was happy to see the improvements to the airport moving forward, saying that, \"We are pleased that the Federal and Provincial Governments are partnering with us to improve facilities at our Airport, an important part of our economic infrastructure.\" <br \/>    <br \/>    The new facility will meet precision approach landing regulations, and accommodate on-site emergency vehicles.  Ridership at the airport continues to grow.  These investments will ensure it has the infrastructure necessary for continued safe, predictable operations. <br \/>    <br \/>    Federal and provincial funding for this project will come from the Infrastructure Stimulus Fund which provides funding to provincial, territorial and municipal construction-ready infrastructure rehabilitation projects that will be built during the 2009 and 2010 construction seasons. <br \/>    <br \/>    The Governments of Canada and Ontario are investing close to $11 billion in joint funding for more than 2,600 projects through such programs as the Infrastructure Stimulus Fund, Building Canada Fund - Communities Component and Major Infrastructure Component, Knowledge Infrastructure Program and RINC\/Ontario REC. These historical investments will help support job creation and strengthen Ontario's economy. <br \/>    <br \/>    <div style=\"text-align: center;\">-30-<\/div><br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064057\/http:\/\/www.waterlooairport.ca\/en\/airportnews\/WestJetToVancouver.asp\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.waterlooairport.ca\/en\/air...oVancouver.asp<\/a><br \/>    For Immediate Release                                                                     December 17, 2009<br \/>    <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">WestJet adds Vancouver non-stop daily service from the Region of Waterloo International Airport (YKF) <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <br \/>     Waterloo Region - <font color=\"red\"><b>As part of an enhanced summer schedule WestJet, Canada's leading low cost airline announced yesterday that they will launch seasonal non-stop daily service to Vancouver from the Region of Waterloo International Airport starting June 27, 2010.<\/b><\/font>  <br \/>    <br \/>     The addition of the Vancouver flight will provide guest's travelling from Waterloo Region with the <font color=\"red\"><b>option to connect on to a number of destinations in the United States including Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and even Honolulu.<\/b><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>     WestJet launched non-stop daily service to Calgary from Waterloo Region in May 2007 providing connections through their hub in Calgary to a number of Western Canadian destinations including Vancouver, Edmonton, Victoria, Abbotsford, Kelowna, Regina and Saskatoon.  <br \/>    <br \/>     \"Vancouver non-stop service is a welcome addition and the morning departure time compliments our evening Calgary service and opens up connections to a number of destinations previously unavailable from our Airport,\" said Ken Seiling, Regional Chair.<br \/>    <br \/>     \"Passengers can now travel non-stop to 3 major Canadian cities from the Region, saving a lot of time and expense driving to other airports,\" said Chris Wood, Airport General Manager.  \"We look forward to further increasing the options available to local residents in the coming months.\"  <br \/>    <br \/>     \"Thanks to strong community support for our Calgary service we are proud to announce the addition of service to Vancouver from the Region of Waterloo International Airport as part of our enhanced summer schedule,\" said Hugh Dunleavy, WestJet's Executive Vice-President, Strategy and Planning. \"We're very pleased to offer the people of Waterloo Region the chance to enjoy some time on the Lower Mainland at an affordable price with a great schedule and daily non-stop service.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    The schedule details of WestJet's new seasonal non-stop service from Kitchener-Waterloo to Vancouver, effective June 27, 2010, are as follows:<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Kitchener-Waterloo to Vancouver (daily) - Introductory fares starting at $189 (taxes and surcharges extra) <\/b><br \/>    <div style=\"margin-left:40px\">Flight - Departure - Arrival<\/div><ul><li style=\"\">From Kitchener-Waterloo - 7:00 a.m. - 8:59 a.m.<\/li><li style=\"\">From Vancouver - 4:30 p.m. - 11:42 p.m.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>    The schedule details of WestJet's year round non-stop service from Kitchener-Waterloo to Calgary are as follows:<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>Kitchener-Waterloo to Calgary (daily) <\/b><br \/>    <div style=\"margin-left:40px\">Flight - Departure - Arrival<\/div><ul><li style=\"\">From Kitchener-Waterloo - 6:25 p.m. - 8:31 p.m.<\/li><li style=\"\">From Calgary - 12:15 p.m. - 5:47 p.m.<\/li><\/ul><br \/>    More detailed information about WestJet's enhanced summer schedule and low introductory fares is available at <a href=\"\/web\/20120220064057\/http:\/\/www.westjet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">www.westjet.com<\/a>.

The airport has its own firefighting equipment, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The airport is located in Woolwich Township, but Wood said the township&#8217;s volunteer fire departments are not willing to provide full-time fire service at the airport.<br \/>    <br \/>    A report on airport fire services is slated to be before regional council this month, listing options ranging from continuing to use a private fire service to developing a fire department at the airport, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;It is difficult to attract airlines here when you don&#8217;t have an on-site fire department,&#8221; Wood said. <br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;My wish would be to have a full-time fire service here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I know it is a contentious issue.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    He said it does not give him a &#8220;warm and fuzzy feeling&#8221; knowing it could take up to 20 minutes for the closest fire department to respond if a small plane crashes.<br \/>    <br \/>    In Sudbury, that municipal airport decided to train their maintenance staff to be firefighters when that facility reached 180,000 passengers, Wood said. That option could also be considered here, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Ironically, his first job in the aviation industry was at the Breslau airport.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wood was a 23-year-old airport-management student at Georgian College in Barrie when he spent a co-op placement at the Waterloo-Wellington Flying Club. He also learned to fly and flew his first solo flight here.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I feel pretty proud that I am able to come back,&#8221; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Another co-op position was at the Victoria airport where an employee took him under his wing and taught him everything about running an airport, lessons that have stayed with him today.<br \/>    <br \/>    In May 1997, Wood got a job with Greater Toronto Airports Authority which operates Pearson International Airport. He oversaw emergency services at the Toronto airport.<br \/>    <br \/>    Six years later, he helped oversee the building of Terminal 1 at Pearson, a project that was so successful, that Wood became part of a consulting team that assisted in the development of similar projects at Heathrow Airport in England, Dubai Department of Civil Aviation and at JFK International Airport in New York City.<br \/>    <br \/>    Then the recession hit in 2008, and the consulting work dried up. Wood decided to look for another job.<br \/>    <br \/>    He was offered work at a number of airports, but it meant moving across Canada and he wanted to be close to his family in Brantford. <br \/>    <br \/>    The job as airport manager here was perfect, said Wood, a father of two young children who is moving to Ayr this month. The position pays $90,217 to $112,767 a year.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I am thrilled,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;I really have my dream job.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    One of his first tasks, he said, was launching an advertising campaign to educate local residents about the airport.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The biggest issue I was facing is that people don&#8217;t know this place exists, and if they do know it exists, they don&#8217;t know they could fly out of here,&#8221; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wood said this growing region is ripe for carriers to offer flights here.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;My job is to make sure the airlines know this airport exists and what potential is here for their businesses,&#8221; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regional council recently approved financial incentives for airlines to come here. &#8220;The idea is for them (airlines) not to lose money,&#8221; Wood said. <br \/>    <br \/>    Another untapped market is vacation charters, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;The airport can only go up.&#8221;","signature":"","date":"01-31-2010 06:24 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"3"},"1453":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20120220064057im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=4&amp;dateline=1262883798","title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"4551"}},"content":"Great to see this guy has a vision greatness for the airport.

T2010-009 was awarded by Council on March 24, 2010, Report F-10-019. The March 24th tender awarded the contract to the low bidder (6 bids received) and this component of the project was 18% under budget. The additional work would be paid from the Airport Combined Services Facility project.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Regional Municipality of Waterloo Purchasing By-law supports the extension of an existing or previous contract where it proves more cost effective or beneficial for the Region, as noted in Part VII-Purchase by Negotiation, Section 21(g).<br \/>    <br \/>    The extension of the contract advances the beginning of construction, helping to meet the aggressive timelines of this ISF project. The tendered unit rates are less than currently estimated for the work by the Cost Consultant and have been deemed competitive through the tendering process. The contractor will already be on-site and therefore would preclude paying separate startup and mobilization costs. The original estimate for this component of the project was $1.25 million; however, based on anticipated savings, the requested extension is for up to $1.0 million plus applicable taxes and disbursements.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>CORPORATE STRATEGIC PLAN:<\/b><br \/>    The Airport Combined Services Facility project supports the Corporate Strategic Plan Focus Area 5 - Infrastructure by &#8220;providing high quality infrastructure and asset management to meet current needs and future growth.&#8221;<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS:<\/b><br \/>    The Airport Combined Services Facility project has a $9,090,692 approved budget of which two-thirds is funded through the Infrastructure Stimulus Funding program ($6,090,692) and one-third by debenturing financing ($3,000,000).

Of particular interest were those by people who had initially been attracted by the novelty of the development, but had soured on it when a few years had given them perspective and the novelty had worn off:<\/span><\/font><br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <font size=\"2\"><span style=\"font-family: century gothic\">&quot;When i first moved to Liberty Village for work in 2007 I was blown away. It was such a breath of fresh air. New small businesses moving in, a reasonable number of new developments and the bare essentials to serve them - a supermarket, blockbuster video, a couple bars\/restaurants\/coffee shops etc, with green space and relatively calm quiet sidewalks with a reasonable density. I hate it there now, it completely sucks. It went from one of my favorite to my absolute least favorite part of the city in 4-5 years. The traffic is a nightmare, the noise and added congestion from construction is brutal.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>   &quot;Over the last 7 years I have watched Liberty village degrade into an absolute disaster. I once spent a great deal of time in that area, going to the gym, groceries, and bars there. And what once was a charming little enclave has degraded into ugly high density, high traffic mess. I feel sorry for anyone who had bought a condo there only to watch the neighborhood turn into its present state.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>   &quot;I checked out Liberty Village back in 2007, at that time there was one condo up, and all the others were planned. The mock-ups in the sales office all looked so nice and shiny. Bliss was one of the condos I was considering. Driving past on the Gardiner now - wow. Just wow. As said, an ugly ghetto of identikit high-rises, complemented with cheaply made townhomes with ridiculously thin walls. I imagine this is what St. Jamestown looked like back in the glory days. I would hate to live there in the shadows of the towers around you, your once unobstructed view of the lake now 40ft away from someone else's bedroom window.&quot;<br \/>    <br \/>   &quot;Liberty Village had a golden period about 5 years ago where it seemed like the revisioning of this area was working - was well thought and well executed. Then came the wall of condos on the south side of the development and it became clear that it was all about cramming as many units into the afforded space as possible with no regard for aesthetics. Liberty Village is now an ugly ghetto of high rise dreck -- a joke played on this formerly handsome area. It doesn't matter how many chic resto-bars inhabit the old warehouses and factories, the wall of monstor condos has spoiled the soup. Oh well, at least the developers and estate agents have gotten rich, and that's what is important in Toronto these days, isn't it?<\/span><\/font>&quot;<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <font size=\"3\"><span style=\"font-family: arial\">So the legitimate cautionary message from the city which is a bit \u201cahead\u201d of us is that not every crane is in retrospect a good news harbinger. We still have the opportunity to get some things right here if approval bodies dig in their heels and resist the call of the crane on occasion.<br \/>   <br \/>   Which projects here do you think will stand the test of time, and which will soon be regretted?<\/span><\/font>","signature":"","date":"","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":false},"43607":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"Metropolis Member","extra_info":{"from":"DOWNTOWN","member_since":"Mar 2010","num_posts":"1324"}},"content":"I have my doubts about Barrelyards.

Of course, if the gridlock is only being experienced by 10% of the population (and mostly during rush hour), I don't see that as such a huge problem.<br \/>    <br \/>    The main problem with Liberty Village imo is that there's very few ways out of the place considering the huge and exploding population. I think Barrelyards has something like 1000-2000 units? Well Liberty Village will have something like 20,000 in a few years. There's only one street exiting LV to the East (East Liberty), none to the South and only King to the North. East Liberty is just a 2 lane street, not very well suited for huge amounts of traffic. King Street is maybe a bit better, but you still get held up by streetcars and most LV residents will still need to use East Liberty St to reach King. Transit is also inadequate, with only infrequent GO trains, not to mention that the Exhibition-Union section of the Lakeshore West route is by far the slowest, and the King streetcar is overcrowded and not very fast either, maybe the Waterfront streetcar is a bit better. The best option is almost certainly biking during rush hour. <br \/>    <br \/>    They are supposed to build a new street to Strachan at least, although Strachan will probably still be quite congested. It will probably be a long time before King's streetcar gets upgraded to a proper LRT or the Waterfront LRT gets build, and will probably be a long time before that section of Lakeshore West is sped up and has more frequent service, and will probably be a long time before the DRL is built, let along the Western part of the DRL (Eastern part seems higher priority atm).","signature":"","date":"04-15-2013 09:41 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"7"},"43638":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":null,"title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener","member_since":"Oct 2010","num_posts":"760"}},"content":"Toronto is currently seeing the correction from 4 decades of over-construction of Commercial in the core.

The name was changed to Waterloo Bedding Co.in 1921.<br \/>    <br \/>    The building is considered a mill construction with sturdy beams and posts, said Marg Rowell, city heritage committee member.<br \/>    <br \/>    Rowell said the lack of designation does not mean the building isn't of significant value.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"There is nothing I can do especially with the attitude of council right now,'' Wideman said. \"It's a foregone conclusion that it (the building) will be removed.''<br \/>    <br \/>    Wideman said he was disappointed at last week's council meeting when politicians voted to defer a proposal to establish a list of heritage buildings. The committee had recommended 35 buildings be recognized for their heritage value and their historical significance.<br \/>    <br \/>    The 35 properties were built before 1857, the year Waterloo was incorporated as a village.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some owners told councillors they were worried a heritage registry could decrease the property values of their buildings. Council then shelved the plan which is expected to return to a council committee meeting on Oct. 6.<br \/>    <br \/>    Scott Amos, director of development approvals for the City of Waterloo, said the rezoning application for the Allen Street West building will go through a complete development process, the same as any other proposal.<br \/>    <br \/>    An informal public meeting will be held at a council committee meeting on Sept. 8.<br \/>    <br \/>    The proposal also includes three houses on Park Street adjacent to the Allen Street building which could also be demolished.<br \/>    <br \/>    Amos said the owner is also considering a heritage assessment of the property although the city does not require it.<br \/>    <br \/>    Amos said the owner's proposal follows city policies and fits in with the city's plan to intensify its core area.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"If this was a heritage property, we would be having a different discussion,'' he said. \"It's a neat-looking building . . . but every property-owner has existing legal rights to his\/her property.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Kinat started his furniture business in 1985 and about 12 years ago moved the business into the Allen Street West building, which was empty.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Loss of factory building would be a sad thing<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    August 30, 2008 <br \/>    Christopher Borth<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/407277\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/article\/407277<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Re: Aging Industrial Site Could Be Demolished -- Aug. 26<br \/>    <br \/>    I am very disappointed to hear that the attractive early 20th century factory building at 21 Allen St. W. will likely be demolished. While the building may not qualify as a heritage property in its own right, it contributes significantly to the appearance and character of what could certainly be called a \"heritage neighbourhood.\" There is no question that tearing it down and building another condominium tower would be a sad and ugly change for this part of Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>    In the mid-20th century, the City of Kitchener allowed many of its most historic and attractive downtown buildings to be torn down.<br \/>    <br \/>    An obvious example would be the lovely neoclassical-styled city hall, of which only the clock tower survives, standing as a sad and lonely reminder at the Joseph Street entrance to Victoria Park.<br \/>    <br \/>    At the time, these buildings were felt not to be deserving of protection. Kitchener's downtown has never really recovered from this careless attitude toward its architectural heritage.<br \/>    <br \/>    However modest the architectural merits of such buildings may be on an individual basis, they are an essential part of our neighbourhoods. Our neighbourhoods are slowly demeaned and eventually lost as these buildings disappear.<br \/>    <br \/>    Intensification of Waterloo's downtown core is a reasonable goal. But please, city councillors, let condominium towers be built in place of parking lots or on underused land, and not at the cost of our most attractive historic buildings.<br \/>    <br \/>    Christopher Borth<br \/>    Waterloo<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Informal Public Meeting<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Sept 8, 2008 - Page 34 <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.city.waterloo.on.ca\/Portals\/57ad7180-c5e7-49f5-b282-c6475cdb7ee7\/CS_CLERKS_Minutes_2008\/20080908_Packet_Committee_of_the_Whole.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.city.waterloo.on.ca\/Porta..._the_Whole.pdf<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Neighbours alarmed by proposed development at historic site<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    By Greg MacDonald, News<br \/>    Sep 03, 2008 <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/141620\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/141620<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    A proposed 19-storey development on Allan Street in uptown Waterloo has raised alarm in the neighbouring communities.<br \/>    <br \/>    An application submitted to the city to develop a condominium tower on the site of the current Ontario Table and Chair building has made residents question whether or not the city should allow a high-density building on a street that is not a major corridor, said Becky Shaw, who lives on Park Street near the proposed site.<br \/>    <br \/>    Shaw, who moved into her home in April, isn't sure if a 19-storey structure will fit in with the neighbourhood.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"You have an idea of what the neighbourhood is going to be like when you move in, but all of a sudden (a few months) later we're at a meeting telling us (a developer) wants to build what looks like a little Empire State Building just down the street,\" she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    She is not against the development of condos nearby, but believes that a structure that will loom over the recently built Bauer lofts will be a little extreme.<br \/>    <br \/>    Shaw and her neighbours are concerned about the traffic and shadow impacts that the 145-unit tower could have on their quiet neighbourhood just outside of the uptown core.<br \/>    <br \/>    They're also concerned about losing heritage buildings, according to Shaw. Besides the Ontario Table and Chair building, which was built during the First World War, Shaw figures that three homes slated for demolition if the proposal goes through were built around 1913.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The neighbourhood is not against development ... we understand the idea of urban sprawl. We're not against the intensification of the downtown core,\" she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"But we need to have development that's not at the expense of heritage and at the expense of our bylaws.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    The current official plan for Waterloo deems the uptown core as a place to intensify, but the land that the condo could be built on is zoned industrial.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city is low on industrial lands and has a policy that it won't rezone any industrial lands.<br \/>    <br \/>    But they're also looking to intensify the core.<br \/>    <br \/>    That means the developers would have to go through an official plan amendment, said Trevor Hawkins, development planner for the city.<br \/>    <br \/>    Aside from re-zoning the land, the developer is also looking to increase density on the land from 250 units per hectare to 465. It's the first application to request that type of density, Hawkins said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city will be receiving many more applications like that as intensification happens, said uptown ward Coun. Ian McLean.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Whether we want to or not, we've got no choice -- we're not growing out, we're growing up,\" he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    That doesn't mean, however, that council will agree with the developer's request.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I'm not taking a position yet,\" he said. \"I'm going to look at the facts.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We need to weigh the options and achieve a balance where the needs of everyone are met.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    That could mean approving the building, allowing the development but reducing the number of storeys or denying it outright, McLean added.<br \/>    <br \/>    Regardless of what happens with this development, the councillor believes that intensification is coming.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Waterloo is trying to be the most environmentally progressive community ... intensification goes a long way towards that,\" he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The informal public meeting for the development will take place on Sept. 8 in council chambers.<br \/>    <br \/>    After that, the proposal will go back to staff and be brought back to council at a later date.","signature":"","date":"12-26-2009 12:39 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"3"},"51":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Residents say 19-storey condominium too big for downtown neighbourhood<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    September 09, 2008 <br \/>    Liz Monteiro, RECORD STAFF - WATERLOO<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/411799\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/news.therecord.com\/News\/Local\/article\/411799<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    Resident after resident asked councillors last night to take another look at a proposed 19-storey condominium development set for Park and Allen streets in the city core.<br \/>    <br \/>    The likelihood of more traffic and noise, less sunshine and the loss of heritage are among the concerns raised about the proposed condo tower.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We are not against development,\" said Marcia Macks Edwards, who lives in the Catalina townhouse development off Allen Street. \"We expect development. We have chosen to live here because we recognize the value of infilling and intensification.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    She urged councillors not to box in the Catalina townhouses.<br \/>    <br \/>    At a committee meeting last night, councillors got more details about the development, which will feature a 145-unit condo tower and nine three-storey townhouses.<br \/>    <br \/>    The developer, Allen Street Holdings, wants to tear down the 95-year-old building at 21 Allen St. W. known as the Ontario Table and Chair Co. Three adjacent houses at 142, 144 and 148 Park St. would also be demolished.<br \/>    <br \/>    The factory, built in 1913, was the original home of the Quality Mattress Co. The name was changed to Waterloo Bedding Co. in 1921. The building is not designated as a heritage property or recognized for its cultural value, but heritage advocates say this doesn't mean it shouldn't be saved.<br \/>    <br \/>    The developer is requesting a zone change for the property, which is about a third of a hectare, Trevor Hawkins, the city development planner, told council. The property is zoned as industrial and the developer wants to change it to multi-residential. Although the city's official plan wants industrial lands unchanged, this property is in the core, where the city wants residential intensification.<br \/>    <br \/>    The developer is also asking for approval from the city to increase density on the property to 465 units per hectare from 250 units per hectare. The development would also include a three-storey parking garage.<br \/>    <br \/>    Rebecca Shaw, who lives at 141 Allen St., said a 19-storey building is excessive. She worries about how the increased density and traffic will affect the area.<br \/>    <br \/>    Residents are also concerned that pedestrians will have to fear for their safety when more cars come in.<br \/>    <br \/>    Bill Kauffeldt, who lives in the Catalina townhouses, said another highrise will create a ghetto of tall buildings. Nearby tower buildings include Clarica and the Bauer lofts.<br \/>    <br \/>    The development likely will not come before council until at least December, Hawkins said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Carol Wiebe, a planning consultant representing developer Randy Kinat, said her client is committed to listening to the neighbourhood's concerns.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We will try and come back with solutions addressing these concerns. It's finding a balance.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    John Arndt, president of North Waterloo Region Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, said the Ontario Table and Chair building is historic and structurally sound and, ultimately, precious. The building is reminiscent of the \"glory days\" of industry in downtown Waterloo nearly 100 years ago, Arndt told council.<br \/>    <br \/>    He said the owner should be complimented for restoring the building and conducting a heritage study even though this wasn't required. \"But the question is, are the costs too great to save this significant building?\"<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Neighbours blast new condo plan<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    By Greg MacDonald - News<br \/>    Sep 10, 2008 <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/142456\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/142456<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    A plan to erect a 19-storey condominium building at the corner of Allen and Park streets drew more fire Monday, with neighbours blasting the development as it was presented to city council.<br \/>    <br \/>    Concerns ranged from traffic impacts to shadows to the safety of children as residents pleaded with the city to do something about the proposed development on the current site of the Ontario Table and Chair building.<br \/>    <br \/>    Developers are asking the city to rezone the site to allow for a 157-unit condominium complex that will require twice the density than the site is currently allocated.<br \/>    <br \/>    But neighbours are worried that this complex, coupled with the nearby Bauer lofts, will destroy their quiet community. The size of the structure is among the chief concerns.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We're not against development, but development has to be reasonable,\" said Becky Shaw, who lives on Park Street across from the site.<br \/>    <br \/>    Shaw and 10 other concerned citizens voiced their complaints about the development, which will also feature townhouses along its frontage.<br \/>    <br \/>    And though residents living in the uptown are aware of the need for intensification, this is taking it too far, said Marcia Macks Edwards, who lives in the Catalina townhouse development just off Allen Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We expect development, we expect mixed use but we also expect respect,\" she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    When the Catalina townhouses were approved by the previous council, they were envisioned as the new benchmark for environmentally friendly living in the uptown, Edwards said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Now they're going to get boxed in by high-rises.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We want you to respect your vision of uptown Waterloo and the official plan,\" she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    John Arndt, president of the North Waterloo Region branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, is also concerned about intensification.<br \/>    <br \/>    He's afraid that the \"Manhattanization\" of the core could lead to a loss of the city's built history -- something that's already ongoing with the potential loss of the Ontario Table and Chair building, which was built in 1913. The structure is typical of industrial facilities built before the First World War and is one of Waterloo's last linkages to that era.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Only a few buildings still stand that still represent the Golden Age of industry in the city,\" Arndt said.<br \/>    <br \/>    All of these concerns are going to become more common as developers start to intensify, said Carol Wiebe, a consultant with MHBC planning.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wiebe, who presented council with some of the plans for the development, said she heard the community's concerns and will take them into account. But it's not only developers who will have to deal with these worries, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think that in the next 10 years we're going to see some tremendous change \" she said. \"Council, staff, developers and the neighbourhoods are going to have to deal with issues as the (intensification) policies are implemented.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"Green\"><font size=\"4\">A record high condo price for Waterloo Region: over $1,000,000!<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Waterloo Region Record: Saturday September 13, 2008 - H7<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/i576.photobucket.com\/albums\/ss203\/UrbanWaterloo\/Waterloo\/144%20Park\/144ParkUptownWaterloo-AdinTheRecord.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->   <div class=\"bbcode_container\">    \t<div class=\"bbcode_quote\">    \t\t<div class=\"quote_container\">    \t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_quote_container\"><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"bbcode_postedby\">    \t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/misc\/quote_icon2.png\" alt=\"Quote\" \/> Originally Posted by <strong>kauffer<\/strong>    \t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t<\/div>    \t\t\t\t<div class=\"message\">December 13, 2008: Some renders you might enjoy, based on the illustrations provided earlier in this thread...<br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/i380.photobucket.com\/albums\/oo248\/Rusty__Shack\/cornerduskloq.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/i380.photobucket.com\/albums\/oo248\/Rusty__Shack\/sidedusklo.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/i380.photobucket.com\/albums\/oo248\/Rusty__Shack\/townhouse.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><\/div>    \t\t\t    \t\t<\/div>    \t<\/div>    <\/div>   <!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->","signature":"","date":"12-26-2009 12:50 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"12-26-2009 01:21 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"4"},"52":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1320406213","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"5693"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">Waterloo isn\u2019t in good position to balance growth pressures with heritage, says critic<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    By Greg MacDonald, Chronicle Staff - News<br \/>    Jan 21, 2009<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/159985\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.waterloochronicle.ca\/news\/article\/159985<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    One of the biggest challenges facing municipalities over the next few decades will be balancing intensification and heritage. <br \/>    But the City of Waterloo isn\u2019t as prepared as its neighbours to deal with the upcoming challenges, according to the former chair of the municipal heritage committee.<br \/>    <br \/>    Dale Wideman, who was a member of the committee for 12 years, outlined his concerns about the fate of heritage structures in the city at a meeting of the North Waterloo Branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario last week.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wideman, along with city planners and university professors, spoke about the need to balance intensification efforts with the area\u2019s historical markers.<br \/>    <br \/>    Both the City of Cambridge and the City of Kitchener have heritage planners on staff, but Waterloo has no such position.<br \/>    <br \/>    That leaves Waterloo\u2019s history at a disadvantage compared to other development concerns, Wideman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWithout a heritage planner to have a good grasp of the issues ... I don\u2019t know how the city will fare,\u201d he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Wideman considered his relationship with city development staff \u201cadversarial at times\u201d and said that heritage matters weren\u2019t always taken seriously.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cHeritage matters were a very last-minute concern,\u201d Wideman said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be on the shoulders of the municipal heritage committee alone.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    That doesn\u2019t mean that the city hasn\u2019t had its successes in preserving its heritage. Wideman points to the Seagram Lofts as a perfect example of intensification and heritage in harmony.<br \/>    <br \/>    But just down the road is an example of heritage being destroyed, he added.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Ontario Table and Chair building, one of the last vestiges of Waterloo\u2019s early 20th-century manufacturing heritage, is set to be replaced by a large-scale condominium.<br \/>    <br \/>    Heritage buildings such as that one can be protected if the city identified significant historical areas in the city.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cMunicipalities should be (responsible) to identify which structures should be considered for retention,\u201d Wideman said.<br \/>    <br \/>    That would primarily be the responsibility of a heritage planner, he added.<br \/>    <br \/>    Heritage planners from Kitchener and Cambridge also presented at the meeting and laid out their plans to preserve history in their respective cities.<br \/>    <br \/>    And even though those municipalities have heritage planners, it doesn\u2019t mean that heritage is safe, said Valerie Spring, the planner with the City of Cambridge.<br \/>    <br \/>    Provincial legislation such as the Places to Grow Act can seriously handcuff any efforts by heritage planners by promoting intensification over preservation, she said.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI\u2019m worried that Places to Grow encourages insidious, incremental degradation of our neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be the responsibility of planners to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    Like Wideman, Spring points to identification of heritage structures as the first key to preservation.<br \/>    <br \/>    But it\u2019s also up to city planners to be aware of heritage concerns when working on development applications.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cRight now it seems like a lot of planning is checking boxes,\u201d Spring said. \u201cBut when one of these issues (about new development) comes up, a group of people always comes to tell us what makes a neighbourhood special.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cI think as planners we need to listen to them.\u201d<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">CONDO PRICING - Deals aplenty if the big city is forsaken<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <b>Buyers in Guelph, Collingwood, Schomberg can get 40% break over Toronto prices<\/b><br \/>    TERRENCE BELFORD, Globe and Mail<br \/>    May 15, 2009 at 12:00 AM EDT<br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/servlet\/story\/RTGAM.20090515.reBelford0515\/REStory\/RealEstate\/home\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/servl...ealEstate\/home<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    New York newspaper editor Horace Greeley had some oft-quoted words of advice for anyone seeking a new beginning in the 19th-century United States: \"Go West, young man, go West.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    You can apply that basic principle to GTA empty nesters looking for relief from stiff new condo prices and the hurly-burly of big-city life. Unless they can easily afford anywhere from $500 to $1,100 a square foot for that new two-bedroom suite and are passionate about staying in the GTA, they might well look west and north to smaller cities and towns such as Waterloo, Schomberg and Collingwoood.<br \/>    <br \/>    All are within an hour's drive \u2014 plus or minus \u2014 from the pleasures and diversions of Toronto, but offer what for many is an appealing combination of lower condo costs and a more relaxed approach to life.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The savings can be significant. We are looking at prices 30 per cent to 40 per cent less than in Toronto \u2014 square foot costs as low as $285 instead of $500,\" says Debbie Cosic of In2ition Realty Inc. She has projects on the go in Collingwood and Schomberg.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Schomberg one offers a deal unlike anything else on the market: A condo on the banks of the Schomberg River plus a villa suite in Wildwood, Fla., about an hour north of St. Petersburg, starting at $350,000 for the pair.<br \/>    <br \/>    The projects are called Triumph North and Triumph South and are being built by SigNature Developments Inc. of Concord. You can buy suites in either individually or opt to buy both for the price of a single suite in Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    Granted that $350,000 price only gets you a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom unit in Schomberg and an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom winter home in Florida, but there are singles and couples who do not need anything larger.<br \/>    <br \/>    Buy a Triumph North one-bedroom alone and it will cost about $180,000, compared with anywhere from $250,000 to $330,000 in the GTA, depending on neighbourhood.<br \/>    <br \/>    If you want more space, it will, of course, cost you more money. Triumph North has suites ranging up to 1,400 square feet with two bedrooms and a den, and Triumph South offers homes that go up in size to 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom bungalows.<br \/>    <br \/>    As for lifestyle, Schomberg is not Yorkville. It is an old Ontario farming village. No bright lights, no vibrating nightspots. But Newmarket is about 15 minutes away by car, as is Vaughan. And for winter months, you can be in Florida in about three hours by jet with regular flights into Orlando, Tampa and St. Petersburg.<br \/>    <br \/>    <b>There is another out-of-town project aimed at empty nesters worth mentioning. Mady Development Corp., which has built such high-end communities as the Boat Club and Les Falls on Marco Island in Florida, Hackberry Creek Estates in Irving, Tex., and the Waterfront Shores lakeside community in Windsor, says it is about to give Waterloo its first luxury condo<\/b>.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"Waterloo has mainly seen loft-style renovations. We saw terrific pent-up demand for a real luxury project,\" says Charles \"Chuck\" Mady, president of the Mady Group.<br \/>    <br \/>    His project is called 144 Park \u2014 Uptown Waterloo. The name comes from the street address. The site is in a well-established neighbourhood that includes a mix of shops, boutiques, caf\u00e9s and nightspots and is about a 10-minute walk from the centre of town.<br \/>    <br \/>    One of the biggest lures for GTA buyers will be price. With 690-square-foot, one-bedroom suites starting in the mid-$200,000 range, GTA buyers would get a luxury suite in downtown Waterloo at the same price as a mid-market one in Toronto. Somewhat larger too: 144 Park's one-bedroom units are about the size of suites with one bedroom and a den in the city.<br \/>    <br \/>    Each has a large balcony, not just a smoker's nook. They range in size from 65 square feet to more than 200. Prices include an underground parking spot and a storage locker.<br \/>    <br \/>    For those wanting bigger spaces, suites run up to 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouses. Three-bedroom condos are in very tight supply in the GTA. There will also be a string of nine, 1,800-square-foot, three-storey, Manhattan brownstone-style townhouses on the site \u2014 each with a private elevator.<br \/>    <br \/>    All suites come with the bells and whistles upscale buyers expect including optional gas-fired ovens and range tops, optional gas fireplaces and the seemingly compulsory granite countertops.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo may be a bit of a stretch from central Toronto. It would probably mean a 1-1\/2-hour drive along the 401, but once there, the city has considerable charm.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 2007, it was named Canada's \"smartest\" city. It not only has two top-ranked universities \u2014 the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University \u2014 but is also the heart of a research triangle that is home to world-class high-tech companies like Research In Motion, creator of the ubiquitous BlackBerry.<br \/>    <br \/>    In many ways, the proliferation of knowledge-based industries makes the city relatively immune to recessions, Mr. Mady points out. While his target market is empty nesters in the local area, he can see the combination of price and a more relaxed lifestyle winning a place in the hearts and pocketbooks of singles and couples in the Toronto area as well.<br \/>    <br \/>    <br \/>    <font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\"><b>New Digs: 144 Park \u2013 Uptown Waterloo is a 19-storey tower with nine townhouses at its base, featuring 150 units in total<\/b><\/font><\/font><br \/>    Lisa Van de Ven, National Post  <br \/>    Published: Friday, May 15, 2009 <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20131109232905\/http:\/\/www.nationalpost.com\/homes\/story.html?id=1600348\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.nationalpost.com\/homes\/story.html?id=1600348<\/a><br \/>    <br \/>    <img src=\"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/a123.g.akamai.net\/f\/123\/12465\/1d\/www.nationalpost.com\/homes\/1600357.bin?size=404x272\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" \/><br \/>    Units include nine-foot ceilings, granite kitchen countertops, engineered hardwood and ceramic tile flooring.<br \/>    <br \/>    Price range: From the mid-$200,000s to over $1-million<br \/>    <br \/>    Location: Park Street and Allen Street, Waterloo<br \/>    <br \/>    Featuring a brick, stone and glass exterior by Turner Fleischer Architects, 144 Park \u2013 Uptown Waterloo is a new project by Mady Development Corp.

It is abundantly clear that all current policies lead to more density, intensification and redevelopment in existing residential areas.<br \/>    <br \/>    It was interesting to see that the editorial staff at both the Record and the Waterloo Chronicle in their June 3rd editions picked up on the issue of intensification initiatives prompted primarily by the recent approval by Waterloo Council of the 144 Park Street project. This is the site of the old Ontario Table and Chair building at Park Street and Allen Street in Waterloo that is now approved to proceed with a 19-storey condominium development along the King Street corridor.<br \/>    <br \/>    The 144 Park Street development did not create the policies that direct developers to better utilize existing infrastructure and create density that would support transit; they are only implementing those policies.<br \/>    <br \/>    Both articles rightly highlight the fact that the intensification that current planning legislation bestows on this Region will, by its very nature, continue to create confrontations between development interests trying to implement it and surrounding neighbourhoods that neither understand the planning context, nor want to understand it, if it means change to their immediate circumstance.<br \/>    <br \/>    Change is something that mankind's psyche inherently shuns even though it has been borne out over the course of history that adaption to change is what so often defines the human spirit. Waterloo Councilor Jan d'Ailly summed it up well when he said, \"Intensification can be scary, it really can.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Scary or not, this Region is on the cusp of significant changes in land use and housing form all being brought about by new regulations emanating from the Province and filtering down through Regional and local Official Plans. We also cannot ignore the huge impact that the possible reinvention of our transit system will have on land uses that will flank its route. The changes to transit being contemplated are viewed as being the catalyst of change supporting additional intensification.<br \/>    <br \/>    There are not many residential neighbourhoods in this Region that should consider themselves exempt from intensification initiatives and all residents across this Region would be well advised to take some time to explore the realities of our new planning regime. Contact the Region or your local municipality with questions about long term land use planning and how it may affect your personal situation. There are not always definitive answers available but in some cases you may find that plans and regulations already exist that are there to promote change.<br \/>    <br \/>    Local Councils have stated for years that they want the power to ensure difficult planning decisions are made locally, not by the Ontario Municipal Board. If this is true, our elected officials must all demonstrate the kind of strength shown by Waterloo Council when they approved the 144 Park Street project. Change doesn't have to be scary if everyone who has a part to play is fully informed.<br \/>    <br \/>    Waterloo Region Home Builders' Association (WRHBA) is the voice of residential construction industry in Waterloo Region representing over 235 members companies.

I was also really impressed with the sales office, that Table and Chair building is really cool, its to bad that the development wasn't the next corner over for that reason alone. Seeing the 3D model of 144 Park really gives you an impression of how impressive this building will be. The roof top terrace also looks really cool, I also think the large wall size windows are another awesome feature. The sales rep told me that they hope to demolish the current buildings in spring and hope to have shovels in the ground for 144 Park in August, with occupancy aimed for 2012. I really wish the BarrelYards and\/or the Centre Block sales office's were open for something to compare to. I also never really noticed that the parking structure is above ground just hidden by the brownstones, which I feel helps to give the building a very prominent podium style. He said this was done to hopefully avoid some of the problems the Bauer Builder faced, with underground parking.  <br \/>    <br \/>    All in all I would like to see this project go ahead, and I would like to see future projects by Mady Developments come to Waterloo Region.","signature":"","date":"01-25-2010 09:30 PM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"","user":false},"num_in_thread":"15"},"1132":{"user":{"name":"","avatar":"\/web\/20131109232905im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=5&amp;dateline=1268703480","title":"City Member","extra_info":{"from":false,"member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"681"}},"content":"That is great news!<br \/>    <br \/>    So they are building even if they haven't sold 70% or so of the units?<br \/>    <br \/>    The fact that the parking is above ground is a great idea after what happened to Bauer.

Waterloo&#8217;s premier outdoor winter wonderland welcomes people and pups to participate in 2 days full of fun.<br \/>   <br \/>   Committee members met Friday to discuss final details, and the project is smoothly on track. Feb. 18-19 the public is welcomed to gather at Waterloo Public square where all the activities can be accessed by foot. <br \/>   <br \/>   The family friendly events include a petting zoo, an ice slide, dog sled rides, face painting, hockey, ice-skating, ice carving, mini putt and much more. <br \/>   <br \/>   The unique and exciting feature of the festival is that the whole family is welcome, Rover too! Seeing all the breeds of dogs is an event in itself. Committee member Patti Brooks says seeing all the breeds is her favourite part of the event.<br \/>   <br \/>   &#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to see the different breeds that come in, how they interact with each other. It&#8217;s the most beautiful display of any dog breed you could possibly imagine,&#8221; said Brooks.<br \/>   <br \/>   And if you think your doggie is the cutest out of the bunch, be sure to enter him or her in Snap Waterloo&#8217;s Ice Dogs Festival Photo Contest. Snap is looking for creative pictures of your pet enjoying their time in the snow. You could win a grand prize of $250. <br \/>   <br \/>   You can even get a professional photo taken with your pup to commemorate your memories at the 2012 festival for only $7. <br \/>   <br \/>   To bring the heat, new to this year will be a chili cook-off. Have a bowl to warm up your day at the festival. <br \/>   <br \/>   Things will get a little spicier the evening of Feb. 18 at the New Orleans themed Mardi Gras benefit. The gala benefits The Humane Society and next years Ice Dogs Festival. The evening will offer the 19+ crowd drinks, tapas style appetizers and a silent auction. <br \/>   <br \/>   You can dance the night away to the Red Pepper Band, a Dixie style jazz band. Masks and beads will be available at the event. Tickets are still for sale at the BIA office at Waterloo City Hall. Use the family and friends codeword &#8220;Jester&#8221; for a special price of $75 for 2 tickets. <br \/>   <br \/>   Despite the weird weather we&#8217;ve had this year, Brooks assures that no matter the weather, Ice Dogs will go on. So bundle up and enjoy a beautiful winter&#8217;s day in Wonderful Waterloo Feb 18-19. <br \/>   <br \/>   ---<br \/>   <br \/>   Visit the Ice Dogs website: <a href=\"\/web\/20130425071130\/http:\/\/www.icedogsfestivalwaterloo.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/www.icedogsfestivalwaterloo.ca\/<\/a><br \/>   <br \/>   Volunteers are still needed.

The festival breathed joy into the chill of winter, lighting up the faces of KW residents. <br \/>    <br \/>        The community enjoyed a variety of actives, and of course the dogs themselves. Strangers chatted and laughed, petting eachothers dogs. The mix of dogs was astounding; breeds and sizes of all types were on display by proud owners.<br \/>    <br \/>    Young or old, the festival had something for everyone. The kids were well entertained with crafts at The Button Factory, ice slides, face painting, dog sled rides and fire trucks. <br \/>    <br \/>    The kids were in awe and excitement to see a fire truck up close, and to have an opportunity to talk with a firefighter. Captain Roger Hergott of the Waterloo Region Fire Services said they brought out two trucks for the event, each with crew of four or five. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cThe best part for us is just meeting the people and seeing the reactions from the kids and the excitement and joy they get from climbing in the truck, seeing the equipment and talking to the crew,\u201d said Capt. Hergott. <br \/>    <br \/>    Meanwhile at another area of the event, all ages marveled at the beautiful ice sculptures, crafted right before their eyes. Artists chipped and chiseled away at a block of ice with a variety tools to create a masterpiece. Groups gathered to watch the process, and many were surprised to see a chainsaw as part of the artist\u2019s toolkit.<br \/>    <br \/>    Chilly festival goers warmed up with a unique treat; a hot baked potato, loaded with a variety of toppings. Those who really wanted to take the heat up a notch went to Chainsaw for the chili cook-off where samples were only a dollar.<br \/>    <br \/>    The energy level and excitement was turned up a notch at the Ropeboard demonstration. Ropeboard uses a cable suspended in the air with a skateboard attached. Daredevils hopped on the board to demo stunts mid-air. <br \/>    <br \/>    Tracy Harms went to the Ice Dogs festival so she could watch her brother Ropeboard with her son Aiden. She and Aiden enjoyed seeing all the dogs. Harms said the community event is a good thing for the region. <br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt makes people happy, it\u2019s something to do, and gets people out of their houses and into the cold,\u201d she said laughing. <br \/>    <br \/>    Other notable moments of the festival included: professional puppy photos, outdoor skating in the square, visiting with miniature horses, and street hockey. Next years festival will be the 10th anniversary of Ice Dogs. <br \/>    <br \/>    <a href=\"\/web\/20130425071130\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/attachment.php?s=ad4da1aa6b1c45930a35d33427080afe&amp;attachmentid=925&amp;d=1330459513\" id=\"attachment925\" rel=\"Lightbox_36451\" ><img src=\"\/web\/20130425071130im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/attachment.php?s=ad4da1aa6b1c45930a35d33427080afe&amp;attachmentid=925&amp;d=1330459513\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Click image for larger version.&nbsp;

A fun-filled family event, it has grown to a weekend long festival that offers something for everyone. Come on out and enjoy all the great events on offer, February 16th - 18th, from 11 a.m. &#8211; 3 p.m., throughout UpTown Waterloo.<br \/>    <br \/>   This year&#8217;s festival will offer up Ice carving competitions, a Chili cook-off featuring some of UpTown Waterloo&#8217;s top eateries, public skating at the Waterloo Public Square, dog sled rides, train rides on Waterloo Central Railway, and much, much more. There will be children&#8217;s activities at the Button Factory, story time courtesy of Waterloo Public Library, the Cambridge Ice Hounds will take to the ice in the public square, and, in a fun-filled road hockey competition, the Waterloo Siskins will take on Waterloo City Councillors. Come on out and cheer them on!<br \/>    <br \/>   &#8220;This is an amazing event that&#8217;s great for the whole family,&#8221; said Winterloo&#8217;s Organizing Committee chair, Tracey Weiler. &#8220;We&#8217;ve expanded the festival to all three days of the Family Day weekend, and added some new activities to celebrate the Ice Dogs&#8217; 10th anniversary.

The merger creates a 13-branch network serving southwestern Ontario.

The merger is scheduled to close on March 1, 2008.<br \/>   Your Neighbourhood Credit Union&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Kerry Hadad, who will continue in the role of CEO of the merged organization said, &#8220;The results are a resounding vote of confidence from our members; we&#8217;re thrilled with the outcome. This partnership means we will be better positioned to serve a more mobile and more demanding population, a challenge we look forward to.

Several generations of families have been employed at this location and the Bauer family has maintained a strong interest and commitment to the community.<br \/>   <br \/>   With the completion of Bauer's commercial consolidation activities, a decision was taken to look for redevelopment opportunities for the site which is strategically located along the central corridor of King Street.<br \/>   <br \/>   At the same time, the principals of Laurence Development LP, a locally based development firm, were keen to undertake a redevelopment project in Waterloo. The location of the Bauer property, coupled with the growing interest in downtown renewal and intensification, make this property an ideal fit.<br \/>   <br \/>   In preparation for the redevelopment undertaking, Laurence Development has completed the necessary background studies including environmental, engineering, planning and architectural design. The company is planning a creative and exciting mixed-use development that will encompass the entire Bauer property located at the corner of King and Allen Streets.<br \/>   <br \/>   In recognition of the historical significance of Bauer Industries to the City of Waterloo, the original Bauer Industries building will be retained as the cornerstone of the new development following restoration to become contemporary commercial office and retail space.<br \/>   <br \/>   The area will be know as the Bauer Buildings and will be designed by Roth Knibb Architects Inc., a renowned Torontofirm. Roth Knibb has been responsible for the design of the new Kitchener Farmers Market building and Old Quebec Street, the successful downtown development in Guelph.<br \/>   <br \/>   Laurence Development is led by local businessman Peter Schwartz, with the support of other local investors including the Seegmiller family.<br \/>   <br \/>   The combined expertise of these principals will ensure the successful outcome of this exciting project.<br \/>   <br \/>   Constructions management will be handled by another loca firm, Projectbuildings.com, which is owned by Heri Polzl.<br \/>   <br \/>   Other local businesses involved include MHBC Planning, Stantec Consulting and Paradigm Transportation Solutions.<br \/>   <br \/>   Preliminary discussions have been held with City o Waterloo officials to outline the redevelopment plans.<br \/>   <br \/>   It is expected that building demolition on selected areas and site restoration will commence this summer and continue through the fall.<br \/>   <br \/>   Planning applications will be submitted shortly to the city and Region of Waterloo, which are expected to be reviewed over the net six to eight months.<br \/>   <br \/>   This redevelopment represents one of the key objectives of local government to encourage development of brownfield sites and intensification of development along the central transit corridor.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font color=\"blue\"><font size=\"4\">Informal Public Meeting: October 3, 2005 (Tentatively) <\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   COB LP (Peter Schwartz)<br \/>   <br \/>   Location: 187 King Street South &amp; 0 Caroline Street<br \/>   <br \/>   Request: To amend the Official Plan designation from Industrial and Special Policy Area No. 4 to Office Commercial.

Partners, the company behind the $40-million project to turn the former Bauer Industries site in downtown Waterloo into a mixed-use complex with trendy lofts, offices, boutiques, cafes and restaurants. <br \/>   <br \/>   Wiebe said the larger lofts, up to almost 2,000 square feet in size, were spoken for first, and some of those sold for more than $400,000. <br \/>   <br \/>   Then, some people bought two or three of the remaining smaller lofts to put them together into larger lofts. <br \/>   <br \/>   So the development, which initially included 96 lofts, will now have 89 residential units altogether, Wiebe said. <br \/>   <br \/>   \"That's the beauty of the modular design -- you can put the units together.\" <br \/>   <br \/>   She said before the presentation centre even opened, about 1,500 people had registered on a website to book appointments for an opportunity to buy the lofts . <br \/>   <br \/>   \"I don't think anyone expected it would be that overwhelming. I know the client was blown away by the response,\" Wiebe said. <br \/>   <br \/>   \"It has also set a new benchmark for prices for highrise condominiums in this region.\" <br \/>   <br \/>   She said people are attracted to the \"great location,\" and the fact that there will be restaurants and cafes to go to within the complex. <br \/>   <br \/>   The lofts will have high ceilings and large windows with great views, and terraces, she said. <br \/>   <br \/>   She said there will also be completely enclosed, self-contained parking underground -- another big draw. <br \/>   <br \/>   In terms of age, people who put deposits down were anywhere from in their 20s to their 70s, Wiebe said. <br \/>   <br \/>   \"There were a lot of professional people who wanted to be in this part of the city,\" she said. <br \/>   <br \/>   \"But we also got a lot of empty-nesters.\" <br \/>   <br \/>   The buildings have yet to be built and the official plan and zoning amendment process for the property is still ongoing. <br \/>   <br \/>   The lofts won't likely be ready for occupation until mid-2007. <br \/>   <br \/>   But the demolition work to make way for the redevelopment began about two weeks ago, Wiebe said. <br \/>   <br \/>   The original Bauer Industries building at King and Allen streets will remain and be renovated for retail and office uses. <br \/>   <br \/>   But the factory additions on the 1.15-hectare (2.8 acre) site are being demolished and two other buildings will be constructed. <br \/>   <br \/>   One of those new buildings, at Caroline and Allen streets, will have the Vincenzo's food market as the anchor customer, as well as offices. <br \/>   <br \/>   The other, on King Street next to the renovated factory, will have retail and offices on the lower floors with the lofts on the upper floors. <br \/>   <br \/>   Although the demolition work is going on now, the construction at street level won't likely be visible until later this year because the excavation and construction of underground parking will need to take place first, she said. <br \/>   <br \/>   The development will bring \"a lot of vitality to this whole block,\" with people living and working in the area, Wiebe said. <br \/>   <br \/>   Everything is conditional on getting the planning approvals, but this is exactly the kind of development that the city wants to see in re-using the original factory building and intensifying the urban core for the transit corridor, she said. <br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">March 2006 (SSC)<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   The developer of the Bauer Lofts in Waterloo is planning to add three storeys due to the high demand for its condominiums.<br \/>   <br \/>   Peter Schwartz, president of Laurence Development LP, said his firm plans to add 39 units to the proposed condo building on the site of the former Bauer Industries property near the city core.<br \/>   <br \/>   Don't expect to see any advertising though.

Partners, the project developer. \"It was almost a year ago that the planning approvals were given (in June, 2006) . . . Everybody has been gearing up for this very important milestone.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   The $50-million project near the city core includes a mix of residential, office and retail space, including restaurants and Vincenzo's food market, which plans to move from Belmont Village in Kitchener.<br \/>   <br \/>   It will be located in a new four-storey building, while the second building will be a 15-storey condominium development called the Bauer Lofts.<br \/>   <br \/>   One of the original Bauer buildings will be restored. Among other things in its history, which goes back to the late 1880s, the plant made insulation for acoustic and thermal purposes in automobiles. The complex of buildings closed in 2001.<br \/>   <br \/>   The next step is to obtain site plan approval and a building permit, Wiebe said. She noted the developer at least made some headway during the site cleanup: It installed wooden shoring around an area excavated for a two-level underground parking garage.<br \/>   <br \/>   Peter Schwartz, head of Laurence Development, couldn't be reached for an interview. But in an e-mail message, he said, <font color=\"blue\">\"Construction will be full steam ahead now.\"<\/font> <img src=\"\/web\/20131110000544im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/Package2\/banana.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"Banana\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/> <br \/>   <br \/>   However, he said it will be several weeks before he has an estimate of the occupancy dates of two new buildings.<br \/>   <br \/>   Wiebe said Schwartz is \"sitting down with the contractor and everybody to hammer out a schedule\" with realistic targets.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"They want to make sure it's thought through before making an announcement.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   Last November, Schwartz said he hoped construction would begin sometime early this year, with the first occupants moving in by March 2008. It now appears the pace of approvals will result in a delay of at least a few months.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"The process has been so frustrating that, even now, it's a bit of a bittersweet moment, because we were hoping to be underway a lot sooner,\" Wiebe said.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"It's a complicated process whenever you're dealing with environmental issues.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   An environmental assessment in 2004-05 identified chlorinated solvents as the contamination, likely associated with the old Bauer Industries operations. However, while that was being cleaned up, more of the same contaminants migrated to the property from an unknown off-site source.<br \/>   <br \/>   <br \/>   <b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">July 2007<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>   <br \/>   Thank you for your interest in Bauer Lofts located in uptown Waterloo.

While many products are involved, beverage companies, including Pepsi, are its main clients.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"As our former company, we had gone through nine acquisitions of U.S.-based companies so it's been very interesting for us that we had had that experience,\" says Chris Varney, general manager and vice-president of operations of the delivery division.<br \/>   <br \/>   Global Beverage Group was spun off from Descartes Systems Group, a Waterloo-based provider of logistics software and services, in 2000. Between 2002 and 2005, it was involved in nine acquisitions of small distribution software firms.<br \/>   <br \/>   The delivery division has about 150 employees, about 70 of whom are based in the HighJump office on Randall Drive in Waterloo.<br \/>   <br \/>   Being part of a larger brand-recognized company has a lot of advantages, says Varney.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We have points of interaction that we did not have before as a solo company. We are interacting a lot more closely with the research and development groups, the marketing groups, the finance groups.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   Other HighJump offices work higher up the supply chain, interacting more with manufacturing and warehouse management.<br \/>   <br \/>   Varney says that before the acquisition, the two companies had many common clients. Now, those customers can deal with one software management company, from production to store delivery.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We are now marketing end-to-end solutions to customers,\" he says.<br \/>   <br \/>   Being part of a bigger company also gives the Waterloo operations a voice.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"We now have a seat at the table with Pepsi-Cola North America in New York,\" Varney says.<br \/>   <br \/>   The Waterloo office has more than 20 software applications that focus specifically on the needs of distributors.<br \/>   <br \/>   Many of the applications run on mobile computerized devices, such as tablets. The software does everything from organize the most effective way to load a truck, to planning the truck's route, to analyzing inventory on a store shelf.<br \/>   <br \/>   The software saves time because orders can be transmitted back to the centre immediately.<br \/>   <br \/>   It also saves gas, a key selling point in a world in which oil prices are increasing and environmental concerns are growing.<br \/>   <br \/>   Clients can pay for a software licence up front or by subscription, a new method that allows clients to pay monthly or annual fees.<br \/>   <br \/>   Staff, including marketing manager Alison Clarke, attended a user conference in San Diego in September. It was the first time clients and HighJump were able to get together to discuss ways to better work as a team and more efficiently utilize HighJump applications, Clarke said.

The photo was taken on June 14, 2005.<br \/>   <br \/>   Aloyes Bauer opened a mill he called A. Bauer and Co. in 1888 after buying the property from a carriage company.<br \/>   <br \/>   The mill made cotton batting and cotton flock for bedding and furniture. In 1915, the company started making seat cushion padding for automobiles. The firm incorporated in 1917, becoming Bauers Limited. At that time the building was 1,533 square metres (16,500 square feet) in size and the company employed 22.<br \/>   <br \/>   In 1933 the company began manufacturing yarn and twine. Around 1939, a new product, sisal padding, was introduced. It was sold to automobile and furniture makers.<br \/>   <br \/>   In 1954, the company began producing foam rubber. It was sold in padding form to both furniture and auto industries for seating.<br \/>   <br \/>   Bauers opened a second factory on Dutton Drive in Waterloo in 1966. The company's name was changed to Bauer Industries Ltd. in 1973.<br \/>   <br \/>   Over the years the company expanded at least 12 times; eventually the buildings consisted of 23,225 square metres (250,000 square feet) at the two Waterloo plants. As of its 110th anniversary in 1998, Bauer Industries employed approximately 250 people, operating the Waterloo plants and one factory in Hildebran, N.C., and a Detroit -area sales office.<br \/>   <br \/>   In the fall of 2001, Bauer Industries Ltd. closed its King Street plant and consolidated operations at its Dutton Drive facility. By then, there were only 160 employees. After Bauer moved out, the King Street building was mainly used for storage.<br \/>   <br \/>   Bauer Industries is still going strong. Its website says: \"Bauer ... the family that keeps vehicles comfortable and quiet!\"<br \/>   <br \/>   The 1.2 hectare (three-acre) site is now being redeveloped by Peter Schwartz's development company, Laurence Development Ltd. Partners, into a mixed-use complex called The Bauer Buildings, containing loft-style condominiums, offices, retail stores and restaurants.<br \/>   <br \/>   The factory additions have been demolished, but the original two-storey factory at King and Allen streets will be retained and will house a restaurant on the main floor and office space upstairs.<br \/>   <br \/>   A second, four-storey building at Caroline and Allen streets will have a food market, with Vincenzo's as the anchor on the main floor and office space on the upper floors.<br \/>   <br \/>   A third building beside the renovated factory will be called the Bauer Lofts. It will feature retail space on the main floor, office space on the second and third floors and condominium lofts on the upper floors. Plans call for the building to be 15 storeys high, with a two-level, underground parking garage. Construction is expected to be finished in 2009.<br \/>   <br \/>   Thanks for your replies. Here's a sampling:<br \/>   <br \/>   Elizabeth Bauer wrote, \"The company was started by my great-great grandfather, Aloyes Bauer.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"Later, it was run by his son Sir Edgar, and at one point, my grandfather, Gene, helped run the plant with some of his siblings.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"The family home is right across the street (the corner of King and Allen) where the Red Cross is.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"One winter, I remember there was a crush along King Street during the Christmas parade, and some of my cousins were able to sit roof-side to get a bird's-eye view of the festivities.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   Dianne Bauer said: \"The sidewalk in front of the family business was our favoured place to watch the annual Santa Claus and Oktoberfest parades with our young children.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"In the early 1980s, Bauer Industries was among the first area employers to provide CPR training for their workers, following Ray Bauer's cardiac arrest in the intersection of King and Allen streets.<br \/>   <br \/>   \"After hitting two other vehicles in the intersection, Ray's car came to rest against the wall of the building below his office, where passing off-duty emergency and medical personnel administered life-saving CPR.\"<br \/>   <br \/>   Good luck with this week's photo.

The first few floors would house a hotel with 150 to 180 rooms. Up to 300 condominium units would share common areas such as a pool. An underground parking garage and meeting halls would be at the rear of the development.<\/b><\/font><br \/>    <br \/>    The Kress Hotel was torn down in 1990. Susiwala said he is also looking at the empty Preston Springs Hotel across the street as a possible addition to the project. The century-old building has seen three aborted renovation attempts over the past two decades.<br \/>    <br \/>    Susiwala envisions a skywalk between old an new, returning the once-grand hotel to its former glory and solving the site's parking shortage.<br \/>    <br \/>    Craig's speech yesterday was a mostly upbeat snapshot of a city that he boasted was debt-free and the third fastest-growing in the province.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We have done well and we will continue to do very well,\" he told about 60 people at the noon-hour event hosted by the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce at the Future Inn on Hespeler Road.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"The city is going through rapid change.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Some changes, such as recent factory closures, have been difficult.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"I think that for many people in the city, it is the best off times, but for some people it is the worst of times,\" Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    About 15,000 city residents live in poverty, about 700 people are waiting for affordable housing and 7,000 emergency food hampers were distributed last year, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Craig has organized a meeting of politicians from across the region for November to look for ways to deal with manufacturing job losses. While local governments can't do much alone, they can search for ways to bring the provincial and federal governments to the table to create a local job plan.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 2009, Craig plans to host a Cambridge \"summit,\" which would bring people together to talk about the city's economy, environment, arts and social challenges \"to build policies for the next decade.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Most of his 20-minute talk focused on growth and downtown renewal.<br \/>    <br \/>    He credits the 2004 opening of the University of Waterloo school of architecture as the catalyst for projects across old Galt.<br \/>    <br \/>    Now the school is talking about expanding, he said, as a slide show of city developments began behind him. They included:<br \/>    <br \/>    The new $30-million city office building, which is on time and on budget, and will open Feb. 11.<br \/>    <br \/>    The \"spectacular\" Waterscape condominium project underway at the north junction of Water and Ainslie streets. The $120-million project will \"change the mindset of who we are as a Cambridge community,\" Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The historic post office on Water Street, which is undergoing a $6-million conversion into a restaurant and meeting centre, with an opening date expected in 2009. \"It will rival any destination in Ontario,\" Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The former Tiger Brand factory, which is being converted by the Lancer Group of Toronto into the Tiger Lofts apartments.<br \/>    <br \/>    An old factory at Water and Concession streets that local developer Amir Klein of AAK construction plans to convert into upscale condominiums.<br \/>    <br \/>    The former city-owned Royal Hotel at Main and Wellington streets, which Klein has also purchased and plans to turn into loft condominiums and street-level retail space.<br \/>    <br \/>    A $6-million theatre, which is planned for downtown near the river, with Drayton Entertainment as the tenant.<br \/>    <br \/>    It was after the slide show that Craig unveiled plans for the hotel-convention centre and development of the American Standard property.<br \/>    <br \/>    The hotel project will fill a need for meeting space across the region and create a magnificent building at the site of the former Kress hotel, he said. \"We are talking about a regionwide impact.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    A developer with experience dealing with heritage buildings bought the American Standard factory last Thursday, Craig said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The city has been working to bring residential development plans forward since the factory's closure was announced May 24.<br \/>    <br \/>    The sink and bathtub factory closed Sept. 13, leaving 58 people out of work.<br \/>    <br \/>    Craig said he worked as matchmaker between the company, the realtor handling the project and a developer.<br \/>    <br \/>    He refused to identify the new owner or provide any other information. The plans are to be formally made public in a month or so, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    The four-storey stone building is a landmark along the Speed River in the heart of old Hespeler. Parts of the 160,000-square-foot factory date from 1858, when Jacob Hespeler founded the village with a factory on the site. In earlier years, the mill complex produced flour, liquor, cotton and wool.<br \/>    <br \/>    In 1913, Stamped Enamel started making sinks there.

I believe this trend of gentrification will continue and will become a predominant focus for developers of the future and has the potential to transform our current landscape into something more vibrant.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kurtis Kivell, Waterloo","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110402040755\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/219-Light-Rail-Transit?p=25288#post25288\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"darkgreen\">cc LRT Letters to <a href=\"mailto:letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com\">letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/a><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"12-31-2009 09:22 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"12-31-2009 09:42 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"2"},"218":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110402040755im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3780"}},"content":"<font color=\"Blue\"><b><u><font size=\"4\">Plant bound for the auction block<\/font><\/u><\/b><\/font><br \/>    <b>Stock and fixtures of city's oldest factory will go to the highest bidder tomorrow<\/b><br \/>    November 28, 2007 <br \/>    KEVIN SWAYZE - RECORD STAFF - CAMBRIDGE<br \/>    <br \/>    The heart of the city's oldest factory will hit the auction block tomorrow.<br \/>    <br \/>    That's when Corporate Assets Inc. will conduct a wall-to-wall sale of all equipment and stock left after American Standard closed its factory in September.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It will be everything from leftover steel to the big presses that made the bathtubs,\" said Linda Thompson, executive assistant to Waterloo developer Shawky Fahel, who bought the property.<br \/>    <br \/>    Fahel plans to convert the top floors of the stone buildings into upscale condominiums and housing for seniors, with commercial space at street level.<br \/>    <br \/>    The sink and bathtub factory closed Sept. 13.

The project will create 120 lofts constructed in buildings that have housed a grist mill, cotton mill, distillery, gas house and bathtub factory. Some of the structures go back 162 years.<br \/>    <br \/>    Many units will overlook the Speed River; others will be near interior courtyards, gardens and pathways.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It could be the best urban space in Cambridge,\" said Paul Sapounzi, an architect and partner with The Ventin Group.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It's more than just the restoration of buildings,\" Sapounzi said. \"It's the creation of a special place.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    He compared the project, which is expected to cost $25 to $30 million, to the Distillery District and Liberty Village projects in Toronto.<br \/>    <br \/>    Sapounzi, who worked with JG Group on the conversion of the Alexander School in Waterloo into condominiums, is supported by Rick Haldenby, director of the University of Waterloo School of Architecture.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"There is nothing like it,\" Haldenby said. \"It will be a rarity in southern Ontario.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    The design has been a collaboration involving the JG Group, the Ventin Group and four senior students from the school of architecture.<br \/>    <br \/>    Jacob Hespeler built the first of the buildings 162 years ago and the project takes its name from the year that grist mill was constructed -- 1847 Riverbank Lofts.<br \/>    <br \/>    For months, Christopher Thacker, director of development for the JG Group, has worked with four student architects to design the lofts, pathways, parking garage and common areas. Thacker wants the redevelopment to be a mixture of residential units and space for retail, arts, crafts and cultural activities.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We do believe in mixed use.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    An old railway spur on the south side of the development could house a variety of commercial and artistic outlets.<br \/>    <br \/>    Some residential units will include wireless technology allowing medical professionals off-site to monitor the blood pressure, blood sugar and well-being of seniors living there.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"We are marrying the best of the past with the best of the future in terms of technology,\" Thacker said. \"The whole idea is to keep seniors in their location of choice.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig likes what he has seen so far.<br \/>    <br \/>    \"It's wonderful, it's absolutely wonderful,\" Craig said. \"It will be the key component in the revitalization of downtown Hespeler.\"<br \/>    <br \/>    Water pours over the Mill Pond Dam on its way into Preston.

A parking gargage with a garden terrace on top fill the space between two old factory buildings along Guelph Avenue. <br \/>    <br \/>    CAMBRIDGE &#8212; Work should start next month on a $30-million redevelopment of the former American Standard factory in old Hespeler.<br \/>    <br \/>    Kitchener developer Shawky Fahel won city approval to create 140 condominium units in the sprawling stone complex, with new stores facing Queen Street and rooftop gardens overlooking the Speed River.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;We&#8217;re aiming to have people moving in by the end of 2011,&#8221; Fahel said.<br \/>    <br \/>    While city councillors voted unanimously to rezone the site to allow homes and stores, Fahel still needs two more approvals.<br \/>    <br \/>    The Grand River Conservation Authority must agree to his flood-proofing plan. The provincial Environment Ministry must also agree to a cleanup plan for chemicals in the soil of the sink and bathtub factory which closed two years ago.<br \/>    <br \/>    Fahel expects both agencies to give approvals to plans by spring so construction crews can move in.<br \/>    <br \/>    First, however, demolition crews will move in to rip out newer, wood-and-metal additions that knitted the original, mid-1800s stone buildings together. In its place, facing Guelph Avenue, a two-level parking garage is planned with a garden terrace on top.<br \/>    <br \/>    All the units in the project will be &#8220;barrier-free&#8221; so they&#8217;re friendly for seniors and anyone with mobility issues, Fahel said.<br \/>    <br \/>    He&#8217;s also talking with the conservation authority about using the dam to power an electricity-generating turbine. The dam was built in the 1800s to provide water power to the buildings on the American Standard site.<br \/>    <br \/>    All the redevelopment is planned upstream of the Guelph Avenue bridge. The rest of the American Standard land downstream of Guelph Avenue will be turned into parkland if Fahel&#8217;s plans unfold as he wants with the city. For now, the concrete-block warehouse there will be transformed into a sales office for the project.<br \/>    <br \/>    Council members praised Fahel for his hard work and efforts to explain his plans to the public. They also believe it will pump life back into the village by the river.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Karl Kiefer thought Fahel&#8217;s project would do for Hespeler what the late Milo Shantz did for downtown St. Jacobs.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I&#8217;ve always believed the potential of a project of this magnitude is what Hespeler needs for rejuvenation,&#8221; he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Coun. Ben Tucci agreed.<br \/>    <br \/>    &#8220;I&#8217;m a firm believer this is going to be a catalyst project for Hespeler.&#8221;","signature":"<a href=\"\/web\/20110402040755\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/showthread.php\/219-Light-Rail-Transit?p=25288#post25288\" target=\"_blank\"><b><font color=\"darkgreen\">cc LRT Letters to <a href=\"mailto:letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com\">letters@wonderfulwaterloo.com<\/a><\/font><\/b><br \/>    <\/a>","date":"12-31-2009 09:30 AM","last_edited":{"timestamp":"12-31-2009 09:36 AM","user":"UrbanWaterloo"},"num_in_thread":"4"},"2261":{"user":{"name":"UrbanWaterloo","avatar":"\/web\/20110402040755im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/image.php?u=2&amp;dateline=1261637798","title":"Moderator","extra_info":{"from":"Kitchener-Waterloo","member_since":"Dec 2009","num_posts":"3780"}},"content":"<b><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"blue\">SUBJECT: MONTHLY REPORT OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY FOR JANUARY 2010<\/font><\/font><\/b><br \/>    Report: P-10-013 <a href=\"\/web\/20110402040755\/http:\/\/region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/region.nsf\/8ef02c0fded0c82a85256e590071a3ce\/5E7A6106A5C4A0C5852576C8005D5BB3\/$file\/P-10-013.pdf?openelement\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/region.waterloo.on.ca\/web\/reg...df?openelement<\/a><br \/>    REGION OF WATERLOO PLANNING, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES<br \/>    Community Planning<br \/>    TO: Chair Jim Wideman and Members of the Planning and Works Committee<br \/>    DATE: February 16, 2010<br \/>    <br \/>    City of Cambridge<br \/>    3.

It produced bathroom fixtures before it closed in 2007.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cIt\u2019s taken 2 1\/2 years . . . we\u2019re standing on top of a mountain today,\u201d Fahel said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Before billboards went up and a website went live, 60 people had already called or emailed wanting information about purchasing one of the 124 units, he said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Fahel expects buyers will be moving in by the end of 2012.<br \/>    <br \/>    Prices for the Riverbank Lofts will start at $159,000. By October, a model unit will be ready in a concrete-block warehouse across Guelph Avenue from the main factory, which will house the sales office.<br \/>    <br \/>    A provincial record of site condition is done, spelling out cleanup and monitoring conditions after people move in. Grand River Conservation Authority staff signed off on flood control plans. The site overlooks the Speed River.<br \/>    <br \/>    There\u2019s \u201cno legal impediment\u201d to pending city approval of the redevelopment, said Cambridge planning commissioner Janet Babcock.<br \/>    <br \/>    Fahel has had to scale back his plans because of a shortage of sewage treatment capacity at the Hespeler waste water plant. It should be a short-term change \u2014 the Hespeler sewage treatment plant is scheduled for an upgrade in 2016.<br \/>    <br \/>    For now, he\u2019ll redevelop three main buildings on the site: one along the river, one along a railway siding off Guelph Avenue and one along Chapel Street. A building closer to Queen Street won\u2019t be redeveloped until the community has more sewage-treatment capacity.<br \/>    <br \/>    Fahel said he will ask Waterloo Region and the City of Cambridge for a tax-deferral agreement to help cover the $1.7 million cleanup cost of the old factory.<br \/>    <br \/>    Cleanup and demolition is expected to start by fall, Fahel said.<br \/>    <br \/>    Industrialist Jacob Hespeler built his first stone building on the site in 1847, and most of the rest of the complex within 20 years. The dam by the old factory held back water to power the flour mill, distillery, wool and cotton-making operations.<br \/>    <br \/>    The plant became a sink factory in 1913, as Stamped and Enamelled Ware Ltd. American Standard bought the company in 1969.<br \/>    <br \/>    The factory closed Sept. 13, 2007.<br \/>    <br \/>    The massive stone walls and wooden beams of the original factories will be used in the living spaces of the complex. Solar panels will produce electricity. Fahel said the project will showcase environmental sustainability.<br \/>    <br \/>    Local businesses look forward to having hundreds of new people moving downtown, said Loris Manni, owner of Gifted Floral on Queen Street.<br \/>    <br \/>    \u201cWe feel it\u2019s going to affect the street . . . to have American Standard closed up all this long is not a good thing.\u201d<br \/>    <br

I can't see how preserving a rusted out water tower is considered protecting heritage.  I thought the point of saving heritage properties is so their life could be extended and the buildings would continue to be enjoyed and <u>functional<\/u> - perhaps under a different use (ie: heritage home now offices or an old steel bridge &quot;saved&quot; and now used as a foot bridge instead of for cars).  But an old rusty water tower?  Other than keeping it as something you see standing there from surrounding neighbourhoods, what new purpose would it serve?  It's rusting out and can't be used to hold water anymore.  I hardly consider it &quot;sculputre&quot;.  What would you do with it?  Cut out windows and a door and call it a &quot;condo&quot;?  Very useful for when global warming causes the water to rise. <img src=\"\/web\/20120510121240im_\/http:\/\/www.wonderfulwaterloo.com\/images\/smilies\/Package1\/RpS_wink.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" title=\"RpS Wink\" class=\"inlineimg\" \/><br \/>    <br \/>    I'm sad as every one else that removing the water tower marks the &quot;end of an era&quot;, but lets be serious here.

This is useful for easily adding links on other forums using HTML, BBCode, etc. More importantly here, it's also customizable. Once you have Create Link installed and working using standard formats, add the following BBCode as a new format:<br \/>    <br \/>    &lt;B&gt;&lt;SIZE=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;COLOR=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;%text%&lt;\/COLOR&gt;&lt;\/SIZE&gt;&lt;\/B&gt; %newline% DATE | AUTHOR | PUBLICATION | &lt;URL=%url%&gt;Link&lt;\/URL&gt; &lt;QUOTE&gt;QUOTE&lt;\/QUOTE&gt;<br \/>    <br \/>    I chose to name my special format WWCode for obvious reasons. Note that in the above I've changed the [ and ] to &lt; and &gt; for illustrative purposes only.
